However, little is known about how user personality affect software engineering, particularly user-developer collaboration. Along this line, we present a preliminary study about the effect of personality traits on user feedback. 56 university students provided feedback on different software features of an e-learning tool used in the course. They also filled out a questionnaire for the Five Factor Model (FFM) personality test. We observed some isolated effects of neuroticism on user feedback: most notably a significant correlation between neuroticism and feedback elaborateness; and between neuroticism and the rating of certain features. The results suggest that sensitivity to frustration and lower stress tolerance may negatively impact the feedback of users. This and possibly other personality characteristics should be considered when leveraging feedback analytics for software requirements engineering.",

While a large body of research has investigated the consequences of passion, we know only little about its antecedents. Integrating trait interaction theory with trait activation theory, this paper examines how personality traits, i.e. conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism impact passion at work across different job situations. Passion has been conceptualized as a two-dimensional construct, consisting of harmonious work passion (HWP) and obsessive work passion (OWP). Our study is based on a sample of N = 824 participants from the myPersonality project. We find a positive relationship between neuroticism and OWP in enterprising environments. Further, we find a three-way interaction between conscientiousness, agreeableness, and enterprising environment in predicting OWP. Our findings imply that the impact of personality configurations on different forms of passion is contingent on the job environment. Moreover, in line with self-regulation theory, the results reveal agreeableness as a \"cool influencer\" and neuroticism as a \"hot influencer\" of the relationship between conscientiousness and work passion. We derive practical implications for organisations on how to foster work passion, particularly HWP, in organisations.",

The correlation-based method suggested that Neuroticism, Openness to Experience, Agreeableness, several facets from each trait, and the External dimensions from LoC mediate how much individuals prefer certain idioms. In addition, our results from the cluster-based analysis showed that Neuroticism, Extraversion, Conscientiousness, and all dimensions from LoC have an effect on preferences for idioms in hierarchy and evolution contexts.

By employing a behavioral psychology framework called OCEAN (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism), we quantitatively gauged the model's responsiveness to tailored prompts. When asked to generate text mimicking an extroverted personality, OCEAN scored the language alignment to that behavioral trait. In our analysis, while \"openness\" presented linguistic ambiguity, \"conscientiousness\" and \"neuroticism\" were distinctly evoked in the OCEAN framework, with \"extroversion\" and \"agreeableness\" showcasing a notable overlap yet distinct separation from other traits. Our findings underscore GPT's versatility and ability to discern and adapt to nuanced instructions. Furthermore, historical figure simulations highlighted the LLM's capacity to internalize and project instructible personas, precisely replicating their philosophies and dialogic styles. However, the rapid advancements in LLM capabilities and the opaque nature of some training techniques make metric proposals degrade rapidly. Our research emphasizes a quantitative role to describe steerability in LLMs, presenting both its promise and areas for further refinement in aligning its progress to human intentions.",

We found that people with higher neuroticism and lower technological comfort showed more agreement with the recommendations without explanations. As more users become exposed to eXplainable AI (XAI) and AI-based systems, we argue that the XAI design should not provide explanations for users with high neuroticism and low technology comfort.

Based on data collected in the experiment, we clustered participants' trust dynamics into three types and assessed differences among the three clusters in terms of personal characteristics, behaviors, performance, and post-experiment ratings. Participants were clustered into three groups, namely Bayesian decision makers, disbelievers, and oscillators. Results showed that the clusters differ significantly in seven personal characteristics: masculinity, positive affect, extraversion, neuroticism, intellect, performance expectancy, and high expectations. The disbelievers tend to have high neuroticism and low performance expectancy. The oscillators tend to have higher scores in masculinity, positive affect, extraversion and intellect. We also found significant differences in the behaviors and post-experiment ratings among the three groups. The disbelievers are the least likely to blindly follow the recommendations made by the automated threat detector. Based on the significant personal characteristics, we developed a decision tree model to predict cluster types with an accuracy of 70%.",

We identified 13 linguistic features crucial for influencing personalities across different levels of the Big Five model of personality. We analyzed how prompts with personality trait information influenced the output of 19 LLMs across five model families. The findings show that models use more anxiety-related words for neuroticism, increase achievement-related words for conscientiousness, and employ fewer cognitive processes words for openness to experience. Some model families excel at adapting language for openness to experience, others for conscientiousness, while only one model adapts language for neuroticism. Our findings show how LLMs tailor responses based on personality cues in prompts, indicating their potential to create persuasive content affecting the mind and well-being of the recipients.",

We use data from smartphones with custom data-collection software distributed to 730 individuals. The data includes information about location, physical motion, face-to-face contacts, online social network friends, text messages and calls. The data is further complemented by questionnaire-based data on basic personality traits. From the phone-based metrics, we define a set of behavioral variables, which we use in a prediction of basic personality traits. We find that predominantly, the Big Five personality traits extraversion and, to some degree, neuroticism are strongly expressed in our data. As an alternative to the Big Five, we investigate whether other linear combinations of the 44 questions underlying the Big Five Inventory are more predictable. In a tertile classification problem, basic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as independent component analysis, increase the predictability relative to the baseline from $11\\%$ to $23\\%$. Finally, from a supervised linear classifier, we were able to further improve this predictability to $33\\%$. In all cases, the most predictable projections had an overweight of the questions related to extraversion and neuroticism. In addition, our findings indicate that the score system underlying the Big Five Inventory disregards a part of the information available in the 44 questions.",

We assess the performance of the PerSense algorithms for personality assessment by conducting an experiment focused on Neuroticism, an important personality trait crucial in mental health analysis and suicide prevention by collecting data from a diverse population with different Neuroticism scores. Our analysis shows that the algorithms achieve comparable results to the ground truth data. Specifically, the PDF approach achieves 97% accuracy when the confidence factor, the logarithmic ratio of the first to the second guess probability, is greater than 3. Additionally, ML approach obtains its highest accuracy, 82.2%, with a multilayer Perceptron classifier. To assess the feasibility of commonsense reasoning analysis, we train ML algorithms to predict responses to commonsense questions. Our analysis of data collected with 300 participants demonstrate that PerSense predicts answers to commonsense questions with 82.3% accuracy using a Random Forest classifier.",

Whilst games are software, game development has unique considerations, so game developers may exhibit different personality traits from other software professionals. We assessed responses from 123 game developers on an International Personality Item Pool Five Factor Model scale and demographic questionnaire using factor analysis. Programmers reported lower Extraversion than designers, artists and production team members; lower Openness than designers and production, and reported higher Neuroticism than production -- potentially linked to burnout and crunch time. Compared to published norms of software developers, game developers reported lower Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Agreeableness, but higher Neuroticism. These personality differences have many practical implications: differences in Extraversion among roles may precipitate communication breakdowns; differences in Openness may induce conflict between programmers and designers. Understanding the relationship between personality traits and roles can help recruiters steer new employees into appropriate roles, and help managers apply appropriate stress management techniques. To realise these benefits, individuals must be distinguished from roles: just because an individual occupies a role does not mean they possess personality traits associated with that role.",

However, little has been done to conduct proper psychological analysis, crucial for explaining the user's outer behaviors from their inner personality. In this paper, we propose an approach that intends to facilitate this line of research by directly predicting the so called Big-Five Personality from user's SNS behaviors. Comparing to the conventional inventory-based psychological analysis, we demonstrate via experimental studies that users' personalities can be predicted with reasonable precision based on their online behaviors. Except for proving some former behavior-personality correlation results, our experiments show that extraversion is positively related to one's status republishing proportion and neuroticism is positively related to the proportion of one's angry blogs (blogs making people angry).",

Here, we focus on the relationship between mobility and social behaviour by analysing trajectories and mobile phone interactions of $\\sim 1,000$ individuals from two high-resolution longitudinal datasets. We identify a connection between the way in which individuals explore new resources and exploit known assets in the social and spatial spheres. We show that different individuals balance the exploration-exploitation trade-off in different ways and we explain part of the variability in the data by the big five personality traits. We point out that, in both realms, extraversion correlates with the attitude towards exploration and routine diversity, while neuroticism and openness account for the tendency to evolve routine over long time-scales. We find no evidence for the existence of classes of individuals across the spatio-social domains. Our results bridge the fields of human geography, sociology and personality psychology and can help improve current models of mobility and tie formation.",

However, we pose the question as broadly as possible in terms of subjects, in the context of universal psychometrics, including humans, machines and hybrids. Namely, in this paper we analyse the following question: is it possible to measure the intelligence of humans and (non-human) bots in a social network or a game just from their user profiles, i.e., by observation, without the use of interactive tests, such as IQ tests, the Turing test or other more principled machine intelligence tests?",

Here, we introduce a method to extract adjective similarities from language models as done with survey-based ratings in traditional psycholexical studies but using millions of times more text in a natural setting. The correlational structure produced through this method is highly similar to that of self- and other-ratings of 435 terms reported by Saucier and Goldberg (1996a). The first three unrotated factors produced using NLP are congruent with those in survey data, with coefficients of 0.89, 0.79, and 0.79. This structure is robust to many modeling decisions: adjective set, including those with 1,710 terms (Goldberg, 1982) and 18,000 terms (Allport & Odbert, 1936); the query used to extract correlations; and language model. Notably, Neuroticism and Openness are only weakly and inconsistently recovered. This is a new source of signal that is closer to the original (semantic) vision of the Lexical Hypothesis. The method can be applied where surveys cannot: in dozens of languages simultaneously, with tens of thousands of items, on historical text, and at extremely large scale for little cost.

The outcomes of this study demonstrate noteworthy performance in personality trait classification, consistently achieving F1-scores exceeding 0.9 across different window sizes and personality traits.

Simulations (n=1,500) for both single-issue and multi-issue negotiation reveal increase in domain complexity with asymmetric issue valuations improve agreement rates but decrease surplus from aggressive negotiation. Through gradient-boosted regression and Shapley explainers, we find high openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism are associated with fair tendencies; low agreeableness and low openness are associated with rational tendencies. Low conscientiousness is associated with high toxicity. These results indicate that LLMs may have built-in guardrails that default to fair behavior, but can be \"jail broken\" to exploit agreeable opponents. We also offer pragmatic insight in how negotiation bots can be designed, and a framework of assessing negotiation behavior based on game theory and computational social science.",

Particularly, we learn specialized LoRA experts to represent various traits, such as openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism. Then, we integrate P-Tailor with a personality specialization loss, promoting experts to specialize in distinct personality traits, thereby enhancing the efficiency of model parameter utilization. Due to the lack of datasets, we also curate a high-quality personality crafting dataset (PCD) to learn and develop the ability to exhibit different personality traits across various topics. We conduct extensive experiments to verify the great performance and effectiveness of P-Tailor in manipulation of the fine-grained personality traits of LLMs.",

Our experiments show that LLMs \"rediscover\" core personality traits such as extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness without relying on direct questionnaire inputs, with the top-5 factors corresponding to Big Five traits explaining 74.3% of the variance in the latent space.

This study evaluates whether LLMs, specifically GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini, can infer Big Five personality traits and generate Big Five Inventory-10 (BFI-10) item scores from user conversations under zero-shot prompting conditions. Our findings reveal that incorporating an intermediate step--prompting for BFI-10 item scores before calculating traits--enhances accuracy and aligns more closely with the gold standard than direct trait inference. This structured approach underscores the importance of leveraging psychological frameworks in improving predictive precision. Additionally, a group comparison based on depressive symptom presence revealed differential model performance. Participants were categorized into two groups: those experiencing at least one depressive symptom and those without symptoms. GPT-4o mini demonstrated heightened sensitivity to depression-related shifts in traits such as Neuroticism and Conscientiousness within the symptom-present group, whereas GPT-4o exhibited strengths in nuanced interpretation across groups. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs to analyze real-world psychological data effectively, offering a valuable foundation for interdisciplinary research at the intersection of artificial intelligence and psychology.",

    "snippet": "Autonomous Personal Mobility Vehicles (APMVs) are designed to address the ``last-mile'' transportation challenge for everyone. When an APMV encounters a pedestrian, it uses an external Human-Machine Interface (eHMI) to negotiate road rights. Through this interaction, passengers also engage with the process. This study examines passengers' gaze behavior toward pedestrians during such interactions, focusing on whether different eHMI designs influence gaze patterns based on passengers' personality traits. The results indicated that when using a visual-based eHMI, passengers often struggled to perceive the communication content. Consequently, passengers with higher Neuroticism scores, who were more sensitive to communication details, might seek cues from pedestrians' reactions. In addition, a multimodal eHMI (visual and voice) using neutral voice did not significantly affect the gaze behavior of passengers toward pedestrians, regardless of personality traits. In contrast, a multimodal eHMI using affective voice encouraged passengers with high Openness to Experience scores to focus on pedestrians' heads. In summary, this study revealed how different eHMI designs influence passengers' gaze behavior and highlighted the effects of personality traits on their gaze patterns toward pedestrians, providing new insights for personalized eHMI designs.",

However, LLMs are often subjected to context-shifting behaviour, resulting in a lack of consistent and interpretable personality-aligned interactions. Adherence to psychological traits lacks comprehensive analysis, especially in the case of dyadic (pairwise) conversations. We examine this challenge from two viewpoints, initially using two conversation agents to generate a discourse on a certain topic with an assigned personality from the OCEAN framework (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism) as High/Low for each trait. This is followed by using multiple judge agents to infer the original traits assigned to explore prediction consistency, inter-model agreement, and alignment with the assigned personality. Our findings indicate that while LLMs can be guided toward personality-driven dialogue, their ability to maintain personality traits varies significantly depending on the combination of models and discourse settings. These inconsistencies emphasise the challenges in achieving stable and interpretable personality-aligned interactions in LLMs.",

The experiment assessed both public expressions ([Speak]) and private thoughts ([Think]) of agents, revealing significant correlations between personality traits and decision-making patterns. Results demonstrate that Openness to Experience had the strongest impact on information acceptance, with curious agents showing high acceptance rates and cautious agents displaying strong skepticism. Extraversion and Conscientiousness also showed notable influence on decision-making, while Neuroticism and Agreeableness exhibited more balanced responses. Additionally, we observed significant discrepancies between public expressions and private thoughts, particularly in agents with friendly and extroverted personalities, suggesting that social context influences decision-making behavior. Our findings contribute to understanding how personality traits shape AI agent behavior in social settings and have implications for developing more nuanced and context-aware AI systems.",

Our research shows that when using a prize phishing email, we find a strong correlation between gender and the response to the phishing email. In addition, we find that the neuroticism is the factor most correlated to responding to this email. Our study also found that people who score high on the openness factor tend to both post more information on Facebook as well as have less strict privacy settings, which may cause them to be susceptible to privacy attacks. In addition, our work detected no correlation between the participants estimate of being vulnerable to phishing attacks and actually being phished, which suggests susceptibility to phishing is not due to lack of awareness of the phishing risks and that realtime response to phishing is hard to predict in advance by online users.   We believe that better understanding of the traits which contribute to online vulnerability can help develop methods for increasing users privacy and security in the future.",

    "snippet": "Over the past decade, online social media has had a tremendous impact on the way people engage in social activism. For instance, about 26M Facebook users expressed their support in upholding the cause of marriage equality by overlaying their profile pictures with rainbow-colored filters. Similarly, hundreds of thousands of users changed their profile pictures to a black dot condemning incidents of sexual violence in India. This act of demonstrating support for social causes by changing online profile pictures is being referred to as pictivism. In this paper, we analyze the psycho-demographic profiles, social networking behavior, and personal interests of users who participated in the Facebook Rainbow campaign. Our study is based on a sample of about 800K detailed profiles of Facebook users combining questionnaire-based psychological scores with Facebook profile data. Our analysis provides detailed insights into psycho-demographic profiles of the campaign participants. We found that personality traits such as openness and neuroticism are both positively associated with the likelihood of supporting the campaign, while conscientiousness exhibited a negative correlation. We also observed that females, religious disbelievers, democrats and adults in the age group of 20 to 30 years are more likely to be a part of the campaign. Our research further confirms the findings of several previous studies which suggest that a user is more likely to participate in an online campaign if a large fraction of his/her friends are already doing so. We also developed machine learning models for predicting campaign participation. Users' personal interests, approximated by Facebook user like activity, turned out to be the best indicator of campaign participation. Our results demonstrated that a predictive model which leverages the aforementioned features accurately identifies campaign participants (AUC=0.76).",

In this paper we investigate automatic personality recognition from Facebook profile pictures. We analyze the effectiveness of four families of visual features and we discuss some human interpretable patterns that explain the personality traits of the individuals. For example, extroverts and agreeable individuals tend to have warm colored pictures and to exhibit many faces in their portraits, mirroring their inclination to socialize; while neurotic ones have a prevalence of pictures of indoor places. Then, we propose a classification approach to automatically recognize personality traits from these visual features. Finally, we compare the performance of our classification approach to the one obtained by human raters and we show that computer-based classifications are significantly more accurate than averaged human-based classifications for Extraversion and Neuroticism.",

Method: In this paper, we perform a quantitative analysis of ecosystem-level data from the code commits and email messages contributed by the developers working on the Apache Software Foundation (ASF) projects, as representative of large scale-distributed projects. Results: We find that there are three common types of personality profiles among Apache developers, characterized in particular by their level of Agreeableness and Neuroticism. We also confirm that developers' personality is stable over time. Moreover, personality traits do not vary with their role, membership, and extent of contribution to the projects. We also find evidence that more open developers are more likely to make contributors to Apache projects. Conclusion: Overall, our findings reinforce the need for future studies on human factors in software engineering to use psychometric tools to control for differences in developers' personalities.",

We polled users on the smartwatch for seven weeks four times per day asking for their mood state. We found that both Happiness and Activation are negatively correlated with heart beats and with the levels of light. People tend to be happier when they are moving more intensely and are feeling less activated during weekends. We also found that people with a lower Conscientiousness and Neuroticism and higher Agreeableness tend to be happy more frequently. In addition, more Activation can be predicted by lower Openness to experience and higher Agreeableness and Conscientiousness. Lastly, we find that tracking people's geographical coordinates might play an important role in predicting Happiness and Activation. The methodology we propose is a first step towards building an automated mood tracking system, to be used for better teamwork and in combination with social network analysis studies.",

Properties in these models, however, cannot be interpreted to concept in prevalent social theories or empirical truth. Also, they usually treat everyone in an uniform fashion. While such assumption is quite misguiding, and thus saliently limits their performance. To overcome these flaws, we devise a personalized evolving model for social network and opinion (PENO), where citizens' ideology is revealed by variable opinions and four dimensions of personality are considered for each entity - leadership, openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism. Opinion propagates via social tie, tie generates from opinion affinity, and personalities integrally work with opinion and tie across evolution. To our best knowledge, PENO is the first attempt to introduce personality impact in network dynamics and verify social science with reasonable visualization during simulation. We also present its probabilistic graph and conceive iterative learning algorithm. Experiments show PENO outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines over two typical prediction tasks - congress voting prediction for legislative bills and friendship prediction on a book-commenting website.

Another, less costly alternative, which leads to potentially more noisy and biased data, is to rely on labels inferred from publicly available information in the profiles of the users, for instance self-reported diagnoses or test results. In this paper, we explore a third strategy, namely to directly use a corpus of items from validated psychometric tests as training data. Items from psychometric tests often consist of sentences from an I-perspective (e.g., \"I make friends easily.\"). Such corpora of test items constitute 'small data', but their availability for many concepts is a rich resource. We investigate this approach for personality profiling, and evaluate BERT classifiers fine-tuned on such psychometric test items for the big five personality traits (openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism) and analyze various augmentation strategies regarding their potential to address the challenges coming with such a small corpus. Our evaluation on a publicly available Twitter corpus shows a comparable performance to in-domain training for 4/5 personality traits with T5-based data augmentation.",

CS is a complex phenomenon that not only encompasses linguistic challenges, but also contains a great deal of complexity in terms of its dynamic behaviour across speakers. Given that the factors giving rise to CS vary from one country to the other, as well as from one person to the other, CS is found to be a speaker-dependant behaviour, where the frequency by which the foreign language is embedded differs across speakers. While several researchers have looked into predicting CS behaviour from a linguistic point of view, research is still lacking in the task of predicting user CS behaviour from sociological and psychological perspectives. We provide an empirical user study, where we investigate the correlations between users' CS levels and character traits. We conduct interviews with bilinguals and gather information on their profiles, including their demographics, personality traits, and traveling experiences. We then use machine learning (ML) to predict users' CS levels based on their profiles, where we identify the main influential factors in the modeling process. We experiment with both classification as well as regression tasks. Our results show that the CS behaviour is affected by the relation between speakers, travel experiences as well as Neuroticism and Extraversion personality traits.",

We developed an experimental framework using Big Five personality surveys and uncovered a previously undetected social desirability bias in a wide range of LLMs. By systematically varying the number of questions LLMs were exposed to, we demonstrate their ability to infer when they are being evaluated. When personality evaluation is inferred, LLMs skew their scores towards the desirable ends of trait dimensions (i.e., increased extraversion, decreased neuroticism, etc). This bias exists in all tested models, including GPT-4/3.5, Claude 3, Llama 3, and PaLM-2. Bias levels appear to increase in more recent models, with GPT-4's survey responses changing by 1.20 (human) standard deviations and Llama 3's by 0.98 standard deviations-very large effects. This bias is robust to randomization of question order and paraphrasing. Reverse-coding all the questions decreases bias levels but does not eliminate them, suggesting that this effect cannot be attributed to acquiescence bias. Our findings reveal an emergent social desirability bias and suggest constraints on profiling LLMs with psychometric tests and on using LLMs as proxies for human participants.",

Both models showed a progressive and libertarian political bias, with GPT-4's biases being slightly, but negligibly, less pronounced. Specifically, on the Political Compass, GPT-3.5 scored -6.59 on the economic axis and -6.07 on the social axis, whereas GPT-4 scored -5.40 and -4.73. In contrast to GPT-3.5, GPT-4 showed a remarkable capacity to emulate assigned political viewpoints, accurately reflecting the assigned quadrant (libertarian-left, libertarian-right, authoritarian-left, authoritarian-right) in all four tested instances. On the Big Five Personality Test, GPT-3.5 showed highly pronounced Openness and Agreeableness traits (O: 85.9%, A: 84.6%). Such pronounced traits correlate with libertarian views in human studies. While GPT-4 overall exhibited less pronounced Big Five personality traits, it did show a notably higher Neuroticism score. Assigned political orientations influenced Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, again reflecting interdependencies observed in human studies. Finally, we observed that test sequencing affected ChatGPT's responses and the observed correlations, indicating a form of contextual memory.",

    "snippet": "The production of peroxide and superoxide is an inevitable consequence of aerobic metabolism, and while these particular \"reactive oxygen species\" (ROSs) can exhibit a number of biological effects, they are not of themselves excessively reactive and thus they are not especially damaging at physiological concentrations. However, their reactions with poorly liganded iron species can lead to the catalytic production of the very reactive and dangerous hydroxyl radical, which is exceptionally damaging, and a major cause of chronic inflammation. We review the considerable and wide-ranging evidence for the involvement of this combination of (su)peroxide and poorly liganded iron in a large number of physiological and indeed pathological processes and inflammatory disorders, especially those involving the progressive degradation of cellular and organismal performance. These diseases share a great many similarities and thus might be considered to have a common cause (i.e. iron-catalysed free radical and especially hydroxyl radical generation). The studies reviewed include those focused on a series of cardiovascular, metabolic and neurological diseases, where iron can be found at the sites of plaques and lesions, as well as studies showing the significance of iron to aging and longevity. The effective chelation of iron by natural or synthetic ligands is thus of major physiological (and potentially therapeutic) importance. As systems properties, we need to recognise that physiological observables have multiple molecular causes, and studying them in isolation leads to inconsistent patterns of apparent causality when it is the simultaneous combination of multiple factors that is responsible. This explains, for instance, the decidedly mixed effects of antioxidants that have been observed, etc...",

CS has been experimentally shown to exist among organ-networks (ONs) of the brain (neurophysiology), lungs (respiration), and heart (cardiovascular reactivity) and to be explained theoretically as a synchronization of the multifractal scaling parameters characterizing each time series.

    "snippet": "The pharmaceutical success of atorvastatin (ATV), a widely employed drug against the \"bad\" cholesterol (LDL) and cardiovascular diseases, traces back to its ability to scavenge free radicals. Unfortunately, information on its antioxidant properties is missing or unreliable. Here, we report detailed quantum chemical results for ATV and its ortho- and para-hydroxy metabolites (o-ATV, p-ATV) in the methanolic phase. They comprise global reactivity indices, bond order indices, and spin densities as well as all relevant enthalpies of reaction (bond dissociation BDE, ionization IP and electron attachment EA, proton detachment PDE and proton affinity PA, and electron transfer ETE). With these properties in hand, we can provide the first theoretical explanation of the experimental finding that, due to their free radical scavenging activity, ATV hydroxy metabolites rather than the parent ATV, have substantial inhibitory effect on LDL and the like. Surprisingly (because it is contrary to the most cases currently known), we unambiguously found that HAT (direct hydrogen atom transfer) rather than SPLET (sequential proton loss electron transfer) or SET-PT (stepwise electron transfer proton transfer) is the thermodynamically preferred pathway by which o-ATV and p-ATV in methanolic phase can scavenge DPPH$^\\bullet$ (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) radicals. From a quantum chemical perspective, the ATV's species investigated are surprising because of the nontrivial correlations between bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, bond order indices and pertaining stretching frequencies, which do not fit the framework of naive chemical intuition.",

    "snippet": "As part of applications dealing with cardiovascular tissue engineering, drop-cast polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) scaffolds have been treated by cold plasma to enhance their adherence to cardiac cells. The scaffolds were treated in a dielectric barrier device where cold plasma was generated in a gaseous environment combining a carrier gas (helium or argon) with/without a reactive gas (molecular nitrogen). We show that an Ar-N2 plasma treatment of 10 min results in significant hydrophilization of the scaffolds, with contact angles as low as 52.4{\\deg} instead of 132.2{\\deg} for native PVDF scaffolds. Correlation between optical emission spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy shows that OH radicals from the plasma phase can functionalize the surface scaffolds, resulting in improved wettability. For all plasma-treated PVDF scaffolds, the adhesion and maturation of primary cardiomyocytes is increased, showing a well-organized sarcomeric structure ({\\alpha}-actinin immunostaining). The efficacy of plasma treatment was also supported by real-time PCR analysis to demonstrate an increased expression of the genes related to adhesion and cardiomyocyte function. Finally, the biocompatibility of the PVDF scaffolds was studied in a cardiac environment, after implantation of acellular scaffolds on the surface of the heart of healthy mice. Seven and 28 days after implantation, no exuberant fibrosis and no multinucleated giant cells were visible in the grafted area, hence demonstrating the absence of foreign body reaction and the biocompatibility of these scaffolds.",

Accurate assessment of this risk is crucial to their course of care. We focus on estimating a patient's risk of cardiovascular death after an acute coronary syndrome based on a patient's raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Learning from this signal is challenging for two reasons: 1) positive examples signifying a downstream cardiovascular event are scarce, causing drastic class imbalance, and 2) each patient's ECG signal consists of thousands of heartbeats, accompanied by a single label for the downstream outcome. Machine learning has been previously applied to this task, but most approaches rely on hand-crafted features and domain knowledge. We propose a method that learns a representation from the raw ECG signal by using a multiple instance learning framework. We present a learned risk score for cardiovascular death that outperforms existing risk metrics in predicting cardiovascular death within 30, 60, 90, and 365 days on a dataset of 5000 patients.",

We demonstrate internal validity by showing that signatures generated on an individual's 2017 data generalize to predict minute-level heart rate from physical activity and sleep for the same individual in 2018, outperforming several time-series forecasting baselines. We also show external validity demonstrating that signatures outperform plain resting heart rate (RHR) in predicting variables associated with cardiovascular functions, such as age and Body Mass Index (BMI).

Using an electricalhydraulic analogy, the model describes the interactions between the heart and retinal circulation through a system of ordinary differential equations. The model is validated against clinical and experimental data, demonstrating its ability to reproduce key cardiovascular parameters (e.g., stroke volume, cardiac output) and ocular hemodynamics (e.g., retinal blood flow). Additionally, we explore in silico the effects of intraocular pressure (IOP) and left ventricular compliance on both local ocular and global systemic circulation, revealing critical dependencies between cardiovascular and ocular health. The results highlight the model's potential for studying cardiovascular diseases with ocular manifestations, paving the way for patient-specific data integration and expanding applications in personalized medicine.",

Despite significant advances in computational and experimental characterization of blood flow, the knowledge that we can acquire from such investigations remains limited by the presence of uncertainty in parameters, low spatiotemporal resolution, and measurement noise. Additionally, extracting useful information from these datasets is challenging. Data-driven modeling techniques have the potential to overcome these challenges and transform cardiovascular flow modeling. In this paper, we review several data-driven modeling techniques, highlight the common ideas and principles that emerge across numerous such techniques, and provide illustrative examples of how they could be used in the context of cardiovascular fluid mechanics. In particular, we discuss principal component analysis (PCA), robust PCA, compressed sensing, the Kalman filter for data assimilation, low-rank data recovery, and several additional methods for reduced-order modeling for cardiovascular flows, including the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), and the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). All of these techniques are presented in the context of cardiovascular flows with simple examples. These data-driven modeling techniques have the potential to transform computational and experimental cardiovascular flow research, and we discuss challenges and opportunities in applying these techniques in the field, looking ultimately towards data-driven patient-specific blood flow modeling.",

This concept of solubility is less demanding than the concept of solubility by elimination of non-reactive strategies (introduced by the author and already studied and applied to economic games). In the work we define the concept of super-reactivity, the preorder of re-activity and, after a characterization of super-reactivity, we are induced to give the concepts of maximal-reactivity and sub-reactivity; the latter definition permits to introduce the iterated elimination of sub-reactive strategies and the solubility of a decision-form game by iterated elimination of sub-reactive strategies. In the paper several examples are developed. Moreover, in the case of normal-form games, the relation between reactivity, with respect to the pair of best reply decision rules, and dominance (with respect to the payoff functions of the game) is completely revealed.",

In this paper, we show how an explicit-in-time ensemble cardiovascular solver offers superior performance with respect to the embarrassingly parallel solution with implicit-in-time algorithms, typical of an inner-outer loop paradigm for non-intrusive uncertainty propagation.
