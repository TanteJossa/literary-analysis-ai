    "snippet": "Within the scientific research community, memory information in the brain is commonly believed to be stored in the synapse - a hypothesis famously attributed to psychologist Donald Hebb. However, there is a growing minority who postulate that memory is stored inside the neuron at the molecular (RNA or DNA) level - an alternative postulation known as the cell-intrinsic hypothesis, coined by psychologist Randy Gallistel. In this paper, we review a selection of key experimental evidence from both sides of the argument. We begin with Eric Kandel's studies on sea slugs, which provided the first evidence in support of the synaptic hypothesis. Next, we touch on experiments in mice by John O'Keefe (declarative memory and the hippocampus) and Joseph LeDoux (procedural fear memory and the amygdala). Then, we introduce the synapse as the basic building block of today's artificial intelligence neural networks. After that, we describe David Glanzman's study on dissociating memory storage and synaptic change in sea slugs, and Susumu Tonegawa's experiment on reactivating retrograde amnesia in mice using laser. From there, we highlight Germund Hesslow's experiment on conditioned pauses in ferrets, and Beatrice Gelber's experiment on conditioning in single-celled organisms without synapses (Paramecium aurelia). This is followed by a description of David Glanzman's experiment on transplanting memory between sea slugs using RNA. Finally, we provide an overview of Brian Dias and Kerry Ressler's experiment on DNA transfer of fear in mice from parents to offspring. We conclude with some potential implications for the wider field of psychology.",

    "snippet": "This paper presents a highly speculative model encompassing the cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus of the mammalian brain. While the majority of computational neuroscience models are founded upon empirical evidence, this model is predicated upon a hardware proposal for a machine learning accelerator. Such a device was designed to perform a specific task, such as speech recognition. The design process employed the principles and techniques typically used by computer architects in the design of devices such as processors. However, it also sought to maintain plausibility with biological systems in accordance with the current understanding of the mammalian brain. In the course of our research, we have identified a functional framework that may help to fill the gaps in current neuroscience, thereby facilitating the explanations for many elusive cognitive-level effects. This paper does not describe the device itself or the rationale behind the design decision, but instead, it presents a concise description of the derived model. In brief, the model provides a functional definition of the cortical column and its structural definition by the minicolumns. It also offers a descriptive model for the corticothalamic and corticostriatal loops, a functional proposal for the hippocampal complex, and a simplified view of the brainstem circuitry involved in auditory processing. The proposed model appears to provide an explanation for a number of cognitive phenomena, including some ERP effects, bottom-up and top-down attention, and the relationship between phenomena such as the cocktail party effect, anterograde and retrograde amnesia following hippocampal complex damage, and so forth.",

    "snippet": "It has been recently discovered that the measles virus can wipe out the adaptive immune system, destroying B lymphocytes and reducing the diversity of non-specific B cells of the infected host. In particular, this implies that previously acquired immunization from vaccination or direct exposition to other pathogens could be erased in a phenomenon named \"immune amnesia\", whose effects can become particularly worrisome given the actual rise of anti-vaccination movements. Here we present the first attempt to incorporate immune amnesia into standard models of epidemic spreading. In particular, we analyze diverse variants of a model that describes the spreading of two concurrent pathogens causing measles and another generic disease: the SIR-IA model. Analytical and computational studies confirm that immune amnesia can indeed have important consequences for epidemic spreading, significantly altering the vaccination coverage required to reach herd-immunity for concurring infectious diseases. More specifically, we uncover the existence of novel propagating and endemic phases which are induced by immune amnesia, that appear both in fully-connected and more structured networks, such as random networks and power-law degree-distributed ones. In particular, the transitions from a quiescent state into these novel phases can become rather abrupt in some cases that we specifically analyze. Furthermore, we discuss the meaning and consequences of our results and their relation with, e.g., immunization strategies, together with the possibility that explosive types of transitions may emerge, making immune-amnesia effects particularly dramatic. This work opens the door to further developments and analyses of immune amnesia effects, contributing, more generally, to the theory of interacting epidemics on complex networks.",

We point out that this variant of a skeptic world is roughly described by the quantum bounded storage model, and although it is a computational obstacle that annuls potential quantum computational advantage, the seemingly undesired properties provide a cryptographic advantage. Namely, providing exotic primitives promised by the quantum bounded storage model, such as unconditionally secure commitment and oblivious transfer schemes, with constructions involving nothing but transmission and measurement of BB84 states.",

Selective Amnesia can be applied to conditional variational likelihood models, which encompass a variety of popular deep generative frameworks, including variational autoencoders and large-scale text-to-image diffusion models. Experiments across different models demonstrate that our approach induces forgetting on a variety of concepts, from entire classes in standard datasets to celebrity and nudity prompts in text-to-image models.

    "snippet": "Disk encryption has become an important security measure for a multitude of clients, including governments, corporations, activists, security-conscious professionals, and privacy-conscious individuals. Unfortunately, recent research has discovered an effective side channel attack against any disk mounted by a running machine\\cite{princetonattack}. This attack, known as the cold boot attack, is effective against any mounted volume using state-of-the-art disk encryption, is relatively simple to perform for an attacker with even rudimentary technical knowledge and training, and is applicable to exactly the scenario against which disk encryption is primarily supposed to defend: an adversary with physical access. To our knowledge, no effective software-based countermeasure to this attack supporting multiple encryption keys has yet been articulated in the literature. Moreover, since no proposed solution has been implemented in publicly available software, all general-purpose machines using disk encryption remain vulnerable. We present Loop-Amnesia, a kernel-based disk encryption mechanism implementing a novel technique to eliminate vulnerability to the cold boot attack. We offer theoretical justification of Loop-Amnesia's invulnerability to the attack, verify that our implementation is not vulnerable in practice, and present measurements showing our impact on I/O accesses to the encrypted disk is limited to a slowdown of approximately 2x. Loop-Amnesia is written for x86-64, but our technique is applicable to other register-based architectures.

    "snippet": "Self-organization of temporal modes in mode-locked lasers usually starts from quantum noise. In this process, incoherent spontaneous emission is steered into coherent ultrashort pulses by dissipation and nonlinearity. In this work, we investigated self-organization dynamics in a mode-locked Mamyshev oscillator starting from coherent pulse seeds as opposed to quantum noise. We observed that the coherence of the seed can be remembered or forgotten depending on the initial inverse population. The excessive nonlinearity in the coherence amnesia regime can devastate the seed coherence, causing the oscillator to undergo a chaotic transition lasting hundreds of round trips before regaining coherence. Conversely, the oscillator converges in only a few round trips for the coherence memory regime. A heterodyne technique was developed to record the fast varying optical phase and characterize these two regimes. Dissipative soliton molecules were synthesized from external pulse pair seeds via the coherence memory pathway. In this case, a plateau of the generated pulse spacing independent from seed pulse spacing, i.e., amnesia of the seed spacing, was observed for close spaced seed pulse pairs. Moreover, we show that pulse seeds can be used for laser reconfiguration and pulse pattern control. Our work paves a way to control transient pulse dynamics and steady pulse forms on demand in mode-locked lasers.",

Although efforts have been made to protect PII in LLMs, existing methods struggle to balance privacy protection with maintaining model utility. In this paper, inspired by studies of amnesia in cognitive science, we propose a novel approach, Proactive Privacy Amnesia (PPA), to safeguard PII in LLMs while preserving their utility. This mechanism works by actively identifying and forgetting key memories most closely associated with PII in sequences, followed by a memory implanting using suitable substitute memories to maintain the LLM's functionality. We conduct evaluations across multiple models to protect common PII, such as phone numbers and physical addresses, against prevalent PII-targeted attacks, demonstrating the superiority of our method compared with other existing defensive techniques. The results show that our PPA method completely eliminates the risk of phone number exposure by 100% and significantly reduces the risk of physical address exposure by 9.8% - 87.6%, all while maintaining comparable model utility performance.",

    "snippet": "The presence of stars on retrograde orbits in disc galaxies is usually attributed to accretion events, both via direct accretion, as well as through the heating of the disc stars. Recent studies have shown that retrograde orbits can also be produced via scattering by dense clumps, which are often present in the early stages of a galaxy's evolution. However, so far it has been unclear whether other internally-driven mechanisms, such as bars, are also capable of driving retrograde motion. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the efficiencies with which bars and clumps produce retrograde orbits in disc galaxies. We do this by comparing the retrograde fractions and the spatial distributions of the retrograde populations in four $N$-body$+$smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of isolated disc galaxies spanning a range of evolutionary behaviours. We find that both bars and clumps are capable of generating significant retrograde populations of order $\\sim 10\\%$ of all stars. We also find that while clump-driven retrograde stars may be found at large galactocentric radii, bar-driven retrograde stars remain in the vicinity of the bar, even if the bar dissolves. Consequently, we find that retrograde stars in the Solar Neighbourhood in the clumpy models are exclusively clump-driven, but this is a trace population, constituting $0.01-0.04\\%$ of the total stellar population in this region. Finally, we find that neither bars (including dissolving ones) nor clumps in the models are able to produce rotationally supported counter-rotating discs.",

It is shown that in the presence of Jupiter, the retrograde co-orbitals will get ejected from Saturn's co-orbital space within a timescale of 10 Myr. This scenario reminds us of the instability of Saturn Trojans caused by both the Great Inequality and the secular resonances. Therefore, we carry out in-depth inspections on both mechanisms and prove that the retrograde resonance overlap, raised by Great Inequality, cannot serve as an explanation for the instability of retrograde co-orbitals, due to the weakness of the retrograde 2:5 resonance with Jupiter at a low eccentricity. However, we discover that both $\\nu_5$ and $\\nu_6$ secular resonances contribute to the slow growth of the eccentricity, therefore, are possibly the primary causes of the instability inside Saturn's retrograde co-orbital space.",

In this paper, we investigate the phase-space structure of the retrograde 1:1 resonance in detail within the framework of the circular restricted three-body problem. We construct a simple integrable approximation for the planar retrograde resonance using canonical contact transformation and numerically employ the averaging procedure in closed form. The phase portrait of the retrograde 1:1 resonance is depicted with the level curves of the averaged Hamiltonian. We thoroughly analyze all possible librations in the co-orbital region and uncover a new apocentric libration for the retrograde 1:1 resonance inside the planet's orbit.

Existing techniques require an automata conversion and compaction step that prevents the use of existing automaton databases and hinders the maintenance of the resulting compact automata. In this paper, we propose Parallel Finite State Machines (PFSMs), which are able to run any DFA- or NFA-like state machines without a previous conversion or compaction step. PFSMs report, online, all the matches found within an input string and they solve the three aforementioned problems. Parallel Finite State Machines require quadratic time and linear memory and they are distributable.

In this work, we put such claims into perspective by analyzing the bibliography of $\\sim$300k papers across 15 different scientific fields submitted to the popular preprint server Arxiv in the time period from 2013 to 2022. We find that all AI subfields (in particular: cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.LG) have similar trends of citation amnesia, in which the age of the bibliography has roughly halved in the last 10 years (from above 12 in 2013 to below 7 in 2022), on average.

We validate our results regarding the role of single resonances and resonances' overlap on orbit stability, by computing surfaces of section of the CR3BP. We conclude that the observed enhanced stability of retrograde planets with respect to prograde planets is due to essential differences between the phase-space topology of retrograde versus prograde resonances (at p/q mean motion ratio, prograde resonance is of order p - q while retrograde resonance is of order p + q).",

We examine the similarities and differences between planar and three dimensional coorbital resonance capture and seek their origin in the stability of coorbital motion at arbitrary inclination. After we present stability maps of the planar prograde and retrograde coorbital resonances, we characterize the new coorbital modes in three dimensions. We see that retrograde mode I (R1) and mode II (R2) persist as we change the relative inclination, while retrograde mode III (R3) seems to exist only in the planar problem. A new coorbital mode (R4) appears in 3D which is a retrograde analogue to an horseshoe-orbit. The Kozai-Lidov resonance is active for retrograde orbits as well as prograde orbits and plays a key role in coorbital resonance capture. Stable coorbital modes exist at all inclinations, including retrograde and polar obits. This result confirms the robustness the coorbital resonance at large inclination and encourages the search for retrograde coorbital companions of the solar system's planets.",

    "snippet": "Context. The fraction of field binaries on retrograde orbits about the Milky Way is significantly lower compared to its prograde counterpart. Chemical and dynamical evidence suggests that the retrograde stellar population originates from $\\omega$ Centauri, which is either the most massive globular cluster (GC) of the Milky Way or the putative core of a former dwarf galaxy. Aims. Star formation conditions required to produce the retrograde binary population are constrained assuming that the retrograde stellar population originates from $\\omega$ Centauri's progenitor. Methods. We match the observed low binary fraction with dynamical population synthesis models, including a universal initial binary population and dynamical processing in star clusters, making use of the publicly available binary population synthesis tool BiPoS1. Results. It is found that either the GC progenitor of $\\omega$ Centauri must have formed with a stellar density of $\\approx 10^8 \\; M_{sun} \\; pc^{-3}$ or the $\\omega$ Centauri dwarf galaxy's progenitor star cluster population must have formed in an extreme starburst with a star formation rate exceeding $1000 \\; M_{sun} \\; yr^{-1}$ and probably a top-heavy embedded-cluster mass function with suppressed low-mass cluster formation. The separation and mass ratio distribution for retrograde field binaries are predicted for comparison with future observations. Conclusions. A viable solution for the deficiency of binaries on retrograde orbits is presented, and star formation conditions for $\\omega$ Centauri as well as orbital parameter distributions for the Milky Way's retrograde binary population are predicted. The dwarf galaxy origin for $\\omega$ Centauri is tentatively preferred within the present context.",

In this study, we focus on the 3D retrograde resonance problem and investigate how the resonant dynamics of a minor body impacts on its own Kozai-Lidov cycle. Firstly we deduce the action-angle variables and canonical transformations that deal with the retrograde orbit specifically. After obtaining the dominant Hamiltonian of this problem, we then carry out the numerical averaging process in closed form to generate phase-space portraits on a $e-\\omega$ space. The retrograde 1:1 resonance is particularly scrutinized in detail, and numerical results from a CRTBP model shows a great agreement with the our semi-analytical portraits. On this basis, we inspect two real minor bodies currently trapped in retrograde 1:1 mean motion resonance. It is shown that they have different Kozai-Lidov states, which can be used to analyze the stability of their unique resonances. In the end, we further inspect the Kozai-Lidov dynamics inside the 2:1 and 2:5 retrograde resonance, and find distinct dynamical bifurcations of equilibrium points on phase-space portraits.",

There is a point of view that electromagnetic fields around rotating black holes are brought to the hole by accretion. In this situation the prograde accreting disks produce weaker large-scale black hole threading magnetic fields, implying weaker jets that in retrograde regimes. The basic goal of this paper is to find the best candidates for retrograde accreting systems in observed active galactic nuclei. We show that active galactic nuclei with low Eddington ratio are really the best candidates for retrograde systems. This conclusion is obtained for kinetically dominated FRII radio galaxies, flat spectrum radio loud narrow line Seyfert I galaxies and a number of nearby galaxies. Our conclusion is that the best candidates for retrograde systems are the noticeable population of active galactic nuclei in the Universe. This result corresponds to the conclusion that in the merging process the interaction of merging black holes with a retrograde circumbinary disk is considerably more effective for shrinking the binary system.",

While mergers in prograde disks have received extensive study, retrograde disks offer distinct dynamics that could promote mergers and produce unique observational signatures. Through numerical simulations, we explore the process of binary-disk decoupling, where the binary's orbital decay rate is faster than the disk's viscous response rate. We find the point of decoupling to be comparable in prograde and retrograde disks, suggesting that any associated electromagnetic (EM) signatures will be produced at comparable times preceding merger. However, we find smaller central cavities for retrograde disks, likely leading to higher-frequency EM emissions and shorter post-merger rebrightening timescales compared to their prograde counterparts. Additionally, we identify quasi-periodic flaring due to instabilities unique to low-viscosity retrograde disks, which may produce distinctive EM signatures.",

    "snippet": "When PageRank began to be used for ranking in Web search, a concern soon arose that older pages have an inherent --- and potentially unfair --- advantage over emerging pages of high quality, because they have had more time to acquire hyperlink citations. Algorithms were then proposed to compensate for this effect. Curiously, in bibliometry, the opposite concern has often been raised: that a growing body of recent papers crowds out older papers, resulting in a collective amnesia in research communities, which potentially leads to reinventions, redundancies, and missed opportunities to connect ideas. A recent paper by Verstak et al. reported experiments on Google Scholar data, which seemed to refute the amnesia, or aging, hypothesis. They claimed that more recently written papers have a larger fraction of outbound citations targeting papers that are older by a fixed number of years, indicating that ancient papers are alive and well-loved and increasingly easily found, thanks in part to Google Scholar. In this paper we show that the full picture is considerably more nuanced. Specifically, the fate of a fixed sample of papers, as they age, is rather different from what Verstak et al.'s study suggests: there is clear and steady abandonment in favor of citations to newer papers. The two apparently contradictory views are reconciled by the realization that, as time passes, the number of papers older than a fixed number of years grows rapidly.",

How has that changed over time, and what factors correlate with this citational attention/amnesia? We chose NLP as our domain of interest and analyzed approximately 71.5K papers to show and quantify several key trends in citation. Notably, around 62% of cited papers are from the immediate five years prior to publication, whereas only about 17% are more than ten years old. Furthermore, we show that the median age and age diversity of cited papers were steadily increasing from 1990 to 2014, but since then, the trend has reversed, and current NLP papers have an all-time low temporal citation diversity. Finally, we show that unlike the 1990s, the highly cited papers in the last decade were also papers with the least citation diversity, likely contributing to the intense (and arguably harmful) recency focus.

In this paper, we argue that these tasks suffer from a common \"interest amnesia\" problem, and a solution exists to mitigate it simultaneously. We figure that long-term cues can be the cornerstone since they reveal multi-interest and clarify long-tail interest. Inspired by the observation, we propose a novel and unified framework in the retrieval stage, \"Trinity\", to solve interest amnesia problem and improve multiple interest modeling tasks. We construct a real-time clustering system that enables us to project items into enumerable clusters, and calculate statistical interest histograms over these clusters. Based on these histograms, Trinity recognizes underdelivered themes and remains stable when facing emerging hot topics. Trinity is more appropriate for large-scale industry scenarios because of its modest computational overheads. Its derived retrievers have been deployed on the recommender system of Douyin, significantly improving user experience and retention. We believe that such practical experience can be well generalized to other scenarios.",

In this paper, we present a novel conceptualization of anti-amnesia in terms of mathematical generalization, leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) perspective. Our method focuses on two key aspects: ensuring optimal NTK convergence and minimizing NTK-related generalization loss, which serve as the theoretical foundation for cross-task generalization. To achieve global NTK convergence, we introduce a principled meta-learning mechanism that guides optimization within an expanded network architecture. Concurrently, to reduce the NTK-related generalization loss, we systematically optimize its constituent factors. Specifically, we initiate self-supervised pre-training on the base session to enhance NTK-related generalization potential. These self-supervised weights are then carefully refined through curricular alignment, followed by the application of dual NTK regularization tailored specifically for both convolutional and linear layers. Through the combined effects of these measures, our network acquires robust NTK properties, ensuring optimal convergence and stability of the NTK matrix and minimizing the NTK-related generalization loss, significantly enhancing its theoretical generalization. On popular FSCIL benchmark datasets, our NTK-FSCIL surpasses contemporary state-of-the-art approaches, elevating end-session accuracy by 2.9\\% to 9.3\\%.",

Existing methods achieve certain success by improving knowledge distillation and exemplar replay for transformer-based detection frameworks, but the intrinsic forgetting mechanisms remain underexplored. In this paper, we dive into the cause of forgetting and discover forgetting imbalance between localization and recognition in transformer-based IOD, which means that localization is less-forgetting and can generalize to future classes, whereas catastrophic forgetting occurs primarily on recognition. Based on these insights, we propose a Divide-and-Conquer Amnesia (DCA) strategy, which redesigns the transformer-based IOD into a localization-then-recognition process. DCA can well maintain and transfer the localization ability, leaving decoupled fragile recognition to be specially conquered. To reduce feature drift in recognition, we leverage semantic knowledge encoded in pre-trained language models to anchor class representations within a unified feature space across incremental tasks. This involves designing a duplex classifier fusion and embedding class semantic features into the recognition decoding process in the form of queries. Extensive experiments validate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, especially for long-term incremental scenarios. For example, under the four-step setting on MS-COCO, our DCA strategy significantly improves the final AP by 6.9%.",

We find that, at all eccentricities, retrograde accretion shrinks the binary semi-major axis and pumps its eccentricity leading to the previously identified possibility of highly eccentric mergers. Contrary to past studies and models, we observe gravitational forces to dominate the binary's orbital evolution as opposed to the physical accretion of mass and momentum. Retrograde accretion variability also differs strongly from prograde solutions. Preeminently, binaries with $e > 0.55$ reveal a unique two-period, double-peaked accretion signature that has not previously been identified. We additionally find evidence for the emergence of retrograde Lindblad resonances at large eccentricities in accordance with predictions from linear theory. Our results suggest that some astrophysical binaries for which retrograde accretion is possible will experience factors-of-a-few times faster orbital decay than in prograde disks and will have their eccentricities pumped beyond the limits found from prograde solutions. Such effects could lead to rapid inward migration for some young stellar binaries, the detection of highly-eccentric LISA mergers, and the tentatively observed turnover at the low-frequency end of the gravitational wave background.",

    "snippet": "Multi-planet systems detected until now are in most cases characterized by hot-Jupiters close to their central star as well as high eccentricities. As a consequence, from a dynamical point of view, compact multi-planetary systems form a variety of the general N-body problem (with N >= 3), whose solutions are not necessarily known. Extrasolar planets are up to now found in prograde (i.e. direct) orbital motions about their host star and often in mean-motion resonances (MMR). In the present paper, we investigate a theoretical alternative suitable for the stability of compact multi-planetary systems. When the outer planet moves on a retrograde orbit in MMR with respect to the inner planet, we find that the so-called retrograde resonances present fine and characteristic structures particularly relevant for dynamical stability. We show that retrograde resonances and their resources open a family of stabilizing mechanisms involving specific behaviors of apsidal precessions. We also point up that for particular orbital data, retrograde MMRs may provide more robust stability compared to the corresponding prograde MMRs.",

We found that capture is mostly retrograde for the asteroids near the planetary orbit and is prograde for those from further orbits. An analytical investigation reveals the intrinsic dynamics of these dependences and gives boundary semimajor axes for the change in prograde/retrograde capture. The numerical calculations support the idea of deriving the analytical formulae and confirm their dependence. Our numerical results show that the capture probability is much higher for bodies from the inner region than for outer ones. These results imply that retrograde irregular satellites of Jupiter are most likely to be captured bodies from the nearby orbits of Jupiter that may have the same origin as Trojan asteroids, while prograde irregular satellites originate from far inner regions such as the main-belt asteroid region.",

We generate synthetic population of ISOs and simulate their ephemerides over a period of 10 years, in order to select those which may be observed by the VRO, based on the nominal characteristics of this survey. We find that the population of the observable ISOs should be significantly biased in favor of retrograde objects. The intensity of this bias is correlated with the slope of the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the population, as well as with the perihelion distances. Steeper SFD slopes lead to an increased fraction of the retrograde orbits, and also of the median orbital inclination. On the other hand, larger perihelion distances result in more symmetric distribution of orbital inclinations. We believe that this is a result of the Holetschek effects, which is already suggested to cause observational bias in orbital distribution of long period comets. The most important implication of our findings is that an excess of retrograde orbits depends on the sizes and the perihelion distances. Therefore, the prograde/retrograde orbits ratio and the median inclination of the discovered population could, in turn, be used to estimate the SFD of the underlying true population of ISOs.",

    "snippet": "With the discovery of Kuiper Belt binaries that have wide separations and roughly equal masses new theories were proposed to explain their formation. Two formation scenarios were suggested by Goldreich and collaborators: In the first, dynamical friction that is generated by a sea of small bodies enables a transient binary to become bound ($L^2s$ mechanism); in the second, a transient binary gets bound by an encounter with a third body ($L^3$ mechanism).   We show that these different binary formation scenarios leave their own unique signatures in the relative abundance of prograde to retrograde binary orbits. This signature is due to stable retrograde orbits that exist much further out in the Hill sphere than prograde orbits. It provides an excellent opportunity to distinguish between the different binary formation scenarios observationally.   We predict that if binary formation proceeded while sub-Hill velocities prevailed, the vast majority of all comparable mass ratio binaries have retrograde orbits. This dominance of retrograde binary orbits is a result of binary formation via the $L^2s$ mechanism, or any other mechanism that dissipates energy in a smooth and gradual manner. For super-Hill velocities binary formation proceeds via the $L^3$ mechanism which produces a roughly equal number of prograde and retrograde binaries. These predictions assume that subsequent orbital evolution due to dynamical friction and dynamical stirring of the Kuiper belt did not alter the sense of the binary orbit after formation.",

We investigate this idea in this work. We generate a generic theoretical expression for retrograde precession in spinning disks that are misaligned with the orbital plane. Our generic theoretical expression matches that which describes the retrograde precession of Earths' equinoxes. By making appropriate assumptions, we reduce our generic theoretical expression to those generated by others, or to those used by others, to describe retrograde precession in protostellar, protoplanetary, X-ray binary, non-magnetic CV DN, quasar and black hole systems. We find that differential rotation and effects on the disk by the accretion stream must be addressed. Our analysis indicates that the best description of a retrogradely precessing spinning, tilted, CV DN accretion disk is a differentially rotating, tilted disk with an attached rotating, tilted ring located near the innermost disk annuli. Our final, reduced expression for retrograde precession agrees well with our numerical simulation results and with selective observational systems that seem to have main sequence secondaries. Our results suggest that tidal torques should be common to a variety of systems where one member is spinning and tilted, regardless if accretion disks are present or not. Our results suggest that the accretion disk's geometric shape directly affects the disk's precession rate.",

A direct comparison with an identical prograde disc shows that: (i) because of the absence of resonances, the cavity size is a factor a(1+e) smaller for retrograde discs; (ii) nonetheless the shrinkage of a circular binary semi--major axis, a, is identical in both cases; (iii) a circular binary in a retrograde disc remains circular while eccentric binaries grow more eccentric. For non-circular binaries, we measure the orbital decay rates and the eccentricity growth rates to be exponential as long as the binary orbits in the plane of its disc. Additionally, for these co-planar systems, we find that interaction (~ non--zero torque) stems only from the cavity edge plus a(1+e) in the disc, i.e. for dynamical purposes, the disc can be treated as a annulus of small radial extent. We find that simple 'dust' models in which the binary- disc interaction is purely gravitational can account for all main numerical results, both for prograde and retrograde discs. Furthermore, we discuss the possibility of an instability occurring for highly eccentric binaries causing it to leave the disc plane, secularly tilt and converge to a prograde system. Our results suggest that there are two stable configurations for binaries in self-gravitating discs: the special circular retrograde case and an eccentric (e~ 0.6) prograde configuration as a stable attractor.",

    "snippet": "The presence of an external tidal field often induces significant dynamical evolutionary effects on the internal kinematics of star clusters. Previous studies investigating the restricted three-body problem with applications to star cluster dynamics have shown that unbound stars on retrograde orbits (with respect to the direction of the cluster's orbit) are more stable against escape than prograde orbits, and predicted that a star cluster might acquire retrograde rotation through preferential escape of stars on prograde orbits. In this study we present evidence of this prediction, but we also illustrate that there are additional effects that cannot be accounted for by the preferential escape of prograde orbits alone. Specifically, in the early evolution, initially underfilling models increase their fraction of retrograde stars without losing significant mass, and acquire a retrograde angular velocity. We attribute this effect to the development of preferentially eccentric/radial orbits in the outer regions of star clusters as they are expanding into their tidal limitation.   We explore the implications of the evolution of the fraction of prograde and retrograde stars for the evolution of the cluster internal rotation, and its dependence on the initial structural properties. Although all the systems studied here evolve towards an approximately solid-body internal rotation with angular velocity equal to about half of the angular velocity of the cluster orbital motion around the host galaxy, the evolutionary history of the radial profile of the cluster internal angular velocity depends on the cluster initial structure.",

Initially, we define a new resonant angle to describe the retrograde MMRs and then perform a series of canonical transformations to formulate the resonant model, in which the phase portrait, resonant centre and resonant width can be analytically determined. To validate the analytical developments, the non-perturbative analysis is made by taking advantage of Poincar\\'e surfaces of section. Some modifications are introduced in the production of Poincar\\'e sections and, in particular, it becomes possible to make direct comparisons between the analytical and numerical results. It is found that there exists an excellent correspondence between the phase portraits and the associated Poincar\\'e sections, and the analytical results agree well with the numerical results in terms of the resonant width and the location of resonant centre. Finally, the numerical approach is utilized to determine the resonant widths and resonant centres over the full range of eccentricity. In particular, seven known examples of retrograde asteroids including 2015 BZ509, 2008 SO218, 1999 LE31, 2000 DG8, 2014 AT28, 2016 LS and 2016 JK24 are found inside the libration zones of retrograde MMRs with Jupiter.

    "snippet": "With hydrodynamic simulations we show that a coplanar disc around one component of a binary can be unstable to global tilting when the disc orbits in a retrograde direction relative to the binary. The disc experiences the largest inclination growth relative to the binary orbit in the outermost radii of the disc, closest to the companion. This tilt instability also occurs for test particles. A retrograde disc is much larger than a prograde disc since it is not tidally truncated and instead spreads outwards to the orbit of the companion. The coplanar retrograde disc remains circular while a coplanar prograde disc can become eccentric. We suggest that the inclination instability is due to a disc resonance caused by the interaction of the tilt with the tidal field of the binary. This model is applicable to Be/X-ray binaries in which the Be star disc may be retrograde relative to the binary orbit if there was a sufficiently strong kick from the supernova that formed the neutron star companion. The accretion on to the neutron star and the resulting X-ray outbursts are weaker in the retrograde case compared to the prograde case.",

From SDSS DR7 we find 3515 isolated satellite systems of galaxies at z<0.03 that contain 8904 satellite galaxies. Using this sample we construct a catalog of 635 satellites associated with 215 host galaxies whose spin directions are determined by our inspection of the SDSS color images and/or by spectroscopic observations in the literature. We divide satellite galaxies into prograde and retrograde orbit subsamples depending on their orbital motion respect to the spin direction of the host. We find that the number of galaxies in prograde orbit is nearly equal to that of retrograde orbit galaxies: the fraction of satellites in prograde orbit is 50+/-2%. The velocity distribution of satellites with respect to their hosts is found almost symmetric: the median bulk rotation of satellites is -1+/- 8 km/s. It is found that the radial distribution of early-type satellites in prograde orbit is strongly concentrated toward the host while that of retrograde ones shows much less concentration. We also find the orbital speed of late-type satellites in prograde orbit increases as the projected distance to the host (R) decreases while the speed decreases for those in retrograde orbit. At R less than 0.1 times the host virial radius the orbital speed decreases in both prograde and retrograde orbit cases. Prograde satellites are on average fainter than retrograde satellites for both early and late morphological types. The u-r color becomes redder as R decreases for both prograde and retrograde orbit late-type satellites. The differences between prograde and retrograde orbit satellites may be attributed to their different origin or the different strength of physical processes that they have experienced through hydrodynamic interactions with their host galaxies.",

    "snippet": "The NEA 2001 SN263 is the target of the ASTER MISSION - First Brazilian Deep Space Mission. Araujo et al. (2012), characterized the stable regions around the components of the triple system for the planar and prograde cases. Knowing that the retrograde orbits are expected to be more stable, here we present a complementary study. We now considered particles orbiting the components of the system, in the internal and external regions, with relative inclinations between $90^{\\circ}< I \\leqslant180^{\\circ}$, i.e., particles with retrograde orbits. Our goal is to characterize the stable regions of the system for retrograde orbits, and then detach a preferred region to place the space probe. For a space mission, the most interesting regions would be those that are unstable for the prograde cases, but stable for the retrograde cases. Such configuration provide a stable region to place the mission probe with a relative retrograde orbit, and, at the same time, guarantees a region free of debris since they are expected to have prograde orbits. We found that in fact the internal and external stable regions significantly increase when compared to the prograde case. For particles with $e=0$ and $I=180^{\\circ}$, we found that nearly the whole region around Alpha and Beta remain stable. We then identified three internal regions and one external region that are very interesting to place the space probe. We present the stable regions found for the retrograde case and a discussion on those preferred regions. We also discuss the effects of resonances of the particles with Beta and Gamma, and the role of the Kozai mechanism in this scenario. These results help us understand and characterize the stability of the triple system 2001 SN263 when retrograde orbits are considered, and provide important parameters to the design of the ASTER mission.",

    "snippet": "Dynamical studies of asteroid populations in retrograde orbits, that is with orbital inclinations greater than 90 degrees, are interesting because the origin of such orbits is still unexplained. Generally, the population of retrograde asteroids includes mostly Centaurs and transneptunian objects (TNOs). A special case is the near-Earth object (343158) 2009 HC82 from the Apollo group. Another interesting object is the comet 333P/LINEAR, which for several years was considered the second retrograde object approaching Earth. Another comet in retrograde orbit, 161P Hartley/IRAS appears to be an object of similar type. Thanks to the large amount of observational data for these two comets, we tested various models of cometary non-gravitational forces applied to their dynamics.   The goal was to estimate which of non-gravitational perturbations could affect the stability of retrograde bodies. In principle, we study the local stability by measuring the divergence of nearby orbits.   We numerically determined Lyapunov characteristic indicators (LCI) and the associated Lyapunov times (LT). This time, our calculations were extended by more advanced models of non-gravitational perturbations (i.e. Yarkovsky drift and in selected cases cometary forces). This allowed us to estimate chaos in the Lyapunov sense.   We found that the Yarkovsky effect for obliquities of $\\gamma=0^{\\circ}$ and $\\gamma=180^{\\circ}$ can change the LT substantially. In most cases, for the prograde rotation, we received more stable solutions. Moreover, we confirmed the role of retrograde resonances in this process. Additionally, the studied cometary effects also significantly influence the long-term behaviour of the selected comets. The LT can reach values from 100 to over 1000 years. Conclusions. All of our results indicate that the use of models with non-gravitational effects for retrograde bodies is clearly justified.",

An important factor that may influence college students' decision on alcohol drinking behavior is socializing at certain contexts across university environment. The present study aims to identify and better understand ecological conditions driving the dynamics of distribution of alcohol use among college-aged students.   To this end, a pilot study is conducted to evaluate students' movement patterns to different contexts across the Arizona State University (ASU) campus, and to use its results to develop an agent-based simulation model designed for examining the role of environmental factors on development and maintenance of alcohol drinking behavior by a representative sample of ASU students. The proposed model that resembles an approximate reaction-diffusion model accounts for movement of agents to various contexts (i.e. diffusion) and alcohol drinking influences within those contexts (i.e., reaction) via a SIR-type model. Of the four most visited contexts at ASU Tempe campus -- Library, Memorial Union, Fitness Center, and Dorm -- the context with the highest visiting probability, Memorial Union, is the most influential and most sensitive context (around $16$ times higher impact of alcohol related influences than the other contexts) on spreading alcohol drinking behavior.   Our findings highlight the crucial role of socialization at local environments on the dynamics of students' alcohol use as well as on the long-term prediction of the college drinking prevalence.",

This includes the interplay of multiple memory systems for consolidating information as posited by the complementary learning systems (CLS) theory and synaptic consolidation for protecting the acquired knowledge from erasure. Thus, we propose a general CL method that creates a synergy between SYNaptic consolidation and dual memory Experience Replay (SYNERgy). Our method maintains a semantic memory that accumulates and consolidates information across the tasks and interacts with the episodic memory for effective replay. It further employs synaptic consolidation by tracking the importance of parameters during the training trajectory and anchoring them to the consolidated parameters in the semantic memory. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to employ dual memory experience replay in conjunction with synaptic consolidation that is suitable for general CL whereby the network does not utilize task boundaries or task labels during training or inference. Our evaluation on various challenging CL scenarios and characteristics analyses demonstrate the efficacy of incorporating both synaptic consolidation and CLS theory in enabling effective CL in DNNs.",

Consciousness is closely related to memory consolidation in that memory is a critical component of conscious experience. So far, many studies have been reported on memory consolidation during consciousness, but there is little research on memory consolidation during unconsciousness. Therefore, we aim to assess the unconsciousness in terms of memory consolidation using electroencephalogram signals. In particular, we used unconscious state during a nap; because sleep is the only state in which consciousness disappears under normal physiological conditions. Seven participants performed two memory tasks (word-pairs and visuo-spatial) before and after the nap to assess the memory consolidation during unconsciousness. As a result, spindle power in central, parietal, occipital regions during unconsciousness was positively correlated with the performance of location memory. With the memory performance, there was also a negative correlation between delta connectivity and word-pairs memory, alpha connectivity and location memory, and spindle connectivity and word-pairs memory. We additionally observed the significant relationship between unconsciousness and brain changes during memory recall before and after the nap. These findings could help present new insights into the assessment of unconsciousness by exploring the relationship with memory consolidation.",

The proposed FN-synapse not only stores the synaptic weight but also stores the synapse's historical usage statistic on the device itself. We also show that the operation of the FN-synapse is near-optimal in terms of the synaptic lifetime and we demonstrate that a network comprising FN-synapses outperforms a comparable EWC network for a small benchmark continual learning task.

Memory-augmented models have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, but current methods are hindered by limited memory capacity and require costly re-training to integrate with a new LLM. In this work, we introduce an associative memory module which can be coupled to any pre-trained (frozen) attention-based LLM without re-training, enabling it to handle arbitrarily long input sequences. Unlike previous methods, our associative memory module consolidates representations of individual tokens into a non-parametric distribution model, dynamically managed by properly balancing the novelty and recency of the incoming data. By retrieving information from this consolidated associative memory, the base LLM can achieve significant (up to 29.7% on Arxiv) perplexity reduction in long-context modeling compared to other baselines evaluated on standard benchmarks. This architecture, which we call CAMELoT (Consolidated Associative Memory Enhanced Long Transformer), demonstrates superior performance even with a tiny context window of 128 tokens, and also enables improved in-context learning with a much larger set of demonstrations.",

    "snippet": "The standard consolidation theory states that short-term memories located in the hippocampus enable the consolidation of long-term memories in the neocortex. In other words, the neocortex slowly learns long-term memories with a transient support of the hippocampus that quickly learns unstable memories. However, it is not clear yet what could be the neurobiological mechanisms underlying these differences in learning rates and memory time-scales. Here, we propose a novel modelling approach of the standard consolidation theory, that focuses on its potential neurobiological mechanisms. In addition to synaptic plasticity and spike frequency adaptation, our model incorporates adult neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus as well as the difference in size between the neocortex and the hippocampus, that we associate with distance-dependent synaptic plasticity. We also take into account the interconnected spatial structure of the involved brain areas, by incorporating the above neurobiological mechanisms in a coupled neural field framework, where each area is represented by a separate neural field with intra- and inter-area connections. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply neural fields to this process. Using numerical simulations and mathematical analysis, we explore the short-term and long-term dynamics of the model upon alternance of phases of hippocampal replay and retrieval cue of an external input. This external input is encodable as a memory pattern in the form of a multiple bump attractor pattern in the individual neural fields. In the model, hippocampal memory patterns become encoded first, before neocortical ones, because of the smaller distances between the bumps of the hippocampal memory patterns. As a result, retrieval of the input pattern in the neocortex at short time-scales necessitates the additional input delivered by the memory pattern of the hippocampus. Neocortical memory patterns progressively consolidate at longer times, up to a point where their retrieval does not need the support of the hippocampus anymore. At longer times, perturbation of the hippocampal neural fields by neurogenesis erases the hippocampus pattern, leading to a final state where the memory pattern is exclusively evoked in the neocortex. Therefore, the dynamics of our model successfully reproduces the main features of the standard consolidation theory. This suggests that neurogenesis in the hippocampus and distance-dependent synaptic plasticity coupled to synaptic depression and spike frequency adaptation, are indeed critical neurobiological processes in memory consolidation.",

Palimpsest consolidation is facilitated by the interaction of hidden biochemical processes that govern synaptic efficacy during varying lifetimes. This arrangement allows idle memories to be temporarily overwritten without being forgotten, in favour of new memories utilised in the short-term. While embedded artificial intelligence can greatly benefit from such functionality, a practical demonstration in hardware is still missing. Here, we show how the intrinsic properties of metal-oxide volatile memristors emulate the hidden processes that support biological palimpsest consolidation. Our memristive synapses exhibit an expanded doubled capacity which can protect a consolidated long-term memory while up to hundreds of uncorrelated short-term memories temporarily overwrite it. The synapses can also implement familiarity detection of previously forgotten memories. Crucially, palimpsest operation is achieved automatically and without the need for specialised instructions. We further demonstrate a practical adaptation of this technology in the context of image vision. This showcases the use of emerging memory technologies to efficiently expand the capacity of artificial intelligence hardware towards more generalised learning memories.",

We describe the first detailed mathematical models for the complete processing pipeline from sensory input and its semantic decoding, i.e., perception, to the formation of episodic and semantic memories and their declarative semantic decodings. Our main hypothesis is that perception includes an active semantic decoding process, which relies on latent representations of entities and predicates, and that episodic and semantic memories depend on the same decoding process. We contribute to the debate between the leading memory consolidation theories, i.e., the standard consolidation theory (SCT) and the multiple trace theory (MTT). The latter is closely related to the complementary learning systems (CLS) framework. In particular, we show explicitly how episodic memory can teach the neocortex to form a semantic memory, which is a core issue in MTT and CLS.",

At present, the risk factors implicated in LATE and those distinguishing LATE from AD are largely unknown. We leveraged an integrated feature selection-based algorithmic approach, to identify important factors differentiating subjects with LATE and/or AD from Control on significantly imbalanced data. We analyzed two datasets ROSMAP and NACC and discovered that alcohol consumption was a top lifestyle and environmental factor linked with LATE and AD and their associations were differential. In particular, we identified a specific subpopulation consisting of APOE e4 carriers. We found that, for this subpopulation, light-to-moderate alcohol intake was a protective factor against both AD and LATE, but its protective role against AD appeared stronger than LATE. The codes for our algorithms are available at https://github.com/xinxingwu-uk/PFV.",
