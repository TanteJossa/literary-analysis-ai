    "snippet": "The United States is in the midst of an opioid epidemic with recent estimates indicating that more than 130 people die every day due to drug overdose. The over-prescription and addiction to opioid painkillers, heroin, and synthetic opioids, has led to a public health crisis and created a huge social and economic burden. Statistical learning methods that use data from multiple clinical centers across the US to detect opioid over-prescribing trends and predict possible opioid misuse are required. However, the semantic heterogeneity in the representation of clinical data across different centers makes the development and evaluation of such methods difficult and non-trivial. We create the Opioid Drug Knowledge Graph (ODKG) -- a network of opioid-related drugs, active ingredients, formulations, combinations, and brand names. We use the ODKG to normalize drug strings in a clinical data warehouse consisting of patient data from over 400 healthcare facilities in 42 different states. We showcase the use of ODKG to generate summary statistics of opioid prescription trends across US regions. These methods and resources can aid the development of advanced and scalable models to monitor the opioid epidemic and to detect illicit opioid misuse behavior. Our work is relevant to policymakers and pain researchers who wish to systematically assess factors that contribute to opioid over-prescribing and iatrogenic opioid addiction in the US.",

    "snippet": "Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs) seek to potentially reduce opioid misuse by restricting the sale of opioids in a state. We examine discontinuities along state borders, where one side may have a PDMP and the other side may not. We find that electronic PDMP implementation, whereby doctors and pharmacists can observe a patient's opioid purchase history, reduces a state's opioid sales but increases opioid sales in neighboring counties on the other side of the state border. We also find systematic differences in opioid sales and mortality between border counties and interior counties. These differences decrease when neighboring states both have ePDMPs, which is consistent with the hypothesis that individuals cross state lines to purchase opioids. Our work highlights the importance of understanding the opioid market as connected across counties or states, as we show that states are affected by the opioid policies of their neighbors.",

However, naloxone has short brain retention ability, which limits its therapeutic efficacy. Developing better opioid antagonists is critical in combating the opioid epidemic.Instead of exhaustively searching in a huge chemical space for better opioid antagonists, we adopt reinforcement learning which allows efficient gradient-based search towards molecules with desired physicochemical and/or biological properties. Specifically, we implement a deep reinforcement learning framework to discover potential lead compounds as better opioid antagonists with enhanced brain retention ability. A customized multi-objective reward function is designed to bias the generation towards molecules with both sufficient opioid antagonistic effect and enhanced brain retention ability. Thorough evaluation demonstrates that with this framework, we are able to identify valid, novel and feasible molecules with multiple desired properties, which has high potential in drug discovery.",

    "snippet": "The United States is experiencing an opioid epidemic, and there were more than 10 million opioid misusers aged 12 or older each year. Identifying patients at high risk of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) can help to make early clinical interventions to reduce the risk of OUD. Our goal is to predict OUD patients among opioid prescription users through analyzing electronic health records with machine learning and deep learning methods. This will help us to better understand the diagnoses of OUD, providing new insights on opioid epidemic. Electronic health records of patients who have been prescribed with medications containing active opioid ingredients were extracted from Cerner Health Facts database between January 1, 2008 and December 31, 2017. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models were applied to predict opioid use disorder risk in the future based on recent five encounters, and compared to Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree and Dense Neural Network. Prediction performance was assessed using F-1 score, precision, recall, and AUROC. Our temporal deep learning model provided promising prediction results which outperformed other methods, with a F1 score of 0.8023 and AUCROC of 0.9369. The model can identify OUD related medications and vital signs as important features for the prediction. LSTM based temporal deep learning model is effective on predicting opioid use disorder using a patient past history of electronic health records, with minimal domain knowledge. It has potential to improve clinical decision support for early intervention and prevention to combat the opioid epidemic.",

    "snippet": "The complex unfolding of the US opioid epidemic in the last 20 years has been the subject of a large body of medical and pharmacological research, and it has sparked a multidisciplinary discussion on how to implement interventions and policies to effectively control its impact on public health. This study leverages Reddit as the primary data source to investigate the opioid crisis. We aimed to find a large cohort of Reddit users interested in discussing the use of opioids, trace the temporal evolution of their interest, and extensively characterize patterns of the nonmedical consumption of opioids, with a focus on routes of administration and drug tampering. We used a semiautomatic information retrieval algorithm to identify subreddits discussing nonmedical opioid consumption, finding over 86,000 Reddit users potentially involved in firsthand opioid usage. We developed a methodology based on word embedding to select alternative colloquial and nonmedical terms referring to opioid substances, routes of administration, and drug-tampering methods. We modeled the preferences of adoption of substances and routes of administration, estimating their prevalence and temporal unfolding, observing relevant trends such as the surge in synthetic opioids like fentanyl and an increasing interest in rectal administration. Ultimately, through the evaluation of odds ratios based on co-mentions, we measured the strength of association between opioid substances, routes of administration, and drug tampering, finding evidence of understudied abusive behaviors like chewing fentanyl patches and dissolving buprenorphine sublingually. We believe that our approach may provide a novel perspective for a more comprehensive understanding of nonmedical abuse of opioids substances and inform the prevention, treatment, and control of the public health effects.",

    "snippet": "Preoperative opioid use has been reported to be associated with higher preoperative opioid demand, worse postoperative outcomes, and increased postoperative healthcare utilization and expenditures. Understanding the risk of preoperative opioid use helps establish patient-centered pain management. In the field of machine learning, deep neural network (DNN) has emerged as a powerful means for risk assessment because of its superb prediction power; however, the blackbox algorithms may make the results less interpretable than statistical models. Bridging the gap between the statistical and machine learning fields, we propose a novel Interpretable Neural Network Regression (INNER), which combines the strengths of statistical and DNN models. We use the proposed INNER to conduct individualized risk assessment of preoperative opioid use. Intensive simulations and an analysis of 34,186 patients expecting surgery in the Analgesic Outcomes Study (AOS) show that the proposed INNER not only can accurately predict the preoperative opioid use using preoperative characteristics as DNN, but also can estimate the patient specific odds of opioid use without pain and the odds ratio of opioid use for a unit increase in the reported overall body pain, leading to more straightforward interpretations of the tendency to use opioids than DNN. Our results identify the patient characteristics that are strongly associated with opioid use and is largely consistent with the previous findings, providing evidence that INNER is a useful tool for individualized risk assessment of preoperative opioid use.",

In this paper, we analyzed opioid poisoning related hospital visits using New York State SPARCS data, which provides diagnoses of patients in hospital visits. We identified all patients with primary diagnosis as opioid poisoning from 2010-2014 for our main studies, and from 2003-2014 for temporal trend studies. We performed demographical based studies, and summarized the historical trends of opioid poisoning. We used frequent item mining to find co-occurrences of diagnoses for possible causes of poisoning or effects from poisoning. We provided zip code level spatial analysis to detect local spatial clusters, and studied potential correlations between opioid poisoning and demographic and social-economic factors.",

    "snippet": "The opioid epidemic, referring to the growing hospitalizations and deaths because of overdose of opioid usage and addiction, has become a severe health problem in the United States. Many strategies have been developed by the federal and local governments and health communities to combat this crisis. Among them, improving our understanding of the epidemic through better health surveillance is one of the top priorities. In addition to direct testing, machine learning approaches may also allow us to detect opioid users by analyzing data from social media because many opioid users may choose not to do the tests but may share their experiences on social media anonymously. In this paper, we take advantage of recent advances in machine learning, collect and analyze user posts from a popular social network Reddit with the goal to identify opioid users. Posts from more than 1,000 users who have posted on three sub-reddits over a period of one month have been collected. In addition to the ones that contain keywords such as opioid, opiate, or heroin, we have also collected posts that contain slang words of opioid such as black or chocolate. We apply an attention-based bidirectional long short memory model to identify opioid users. Experimental results show that the approaches significantly outperform competitive algorithms in terms of F1-score. Furthermore, the model allows us to extract most informative words, such as opiate, opioid, and black, from posts via the attention layer, which provides more insights on how the machine learning algorithm works in distinguishing drug users from non-drug users.",

    "snippet": "The opioid crisis remains a critical public health challenge in the United States. Despite national efforts to reduce opioid prescribing rates by nearly 45\\% between 2011 and 2021, opioid overdose deaths more than tripled during this same period. This alarming trend reflects a major shift in the crisis, with illegal opioids now driving the majority of overdose deaths instead of prescription opioids. Although much attention has been given to supply-side factors fueling this transition, the underlying socioeconomic conditions that perpetuate and exacerbate opioid misuse remain less understood. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic intensified the opioid crisis through widespread social isolation and record-high unemployment; consequently, understanding the socioeconomic drivers of this epidemic has become even more crucial in recent years. To address this need, our study examines the correlation between opioid-related mortality and thirteen components of the Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). Leveraging a nationwide county-level dataset spanning consecutive years from 2010 to 2022, this study integrates empirical insights from exploratory data analysis with feature importance metrics derived from machine learning models. Our findings highlight critical social factors strongly correlated with opioid-related mortality, emphasizing their potential roles in worsening the epidemic when their levels are high and mitigating it when their levels are low.",

    "snippet": "Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) has reached an epidemic level in the US. Diversion of unused prescription opioids to secondary users and black market significantly contributes to the abuse and misuse of these highly addictive drugs, leading to the increased risk of OUD and accidental opioid overdose within communities. Hence, it is critical to design effective strategies to reduce the non-medical use of opioids that can occur via diversion at the patient level. In this paper, we aim to address this critical public health problem by designing strategies for the return and safe disposal of unused prescription opioids. We propose a data-driven optimization framework to determine the optimal incentive disbursement plans and locations of easily accessible opioid disposal kiosks to motivate prescription opioid users of diverse profiles in returning their unused opioids. We develop a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming (MINLP) model to solve the decision problem, followed by a reformulation scheme using Benders Decomposition that results in a computationally efficient solution. We present a case study to show the benefits and usability of the model using a dataset created from Massachusetts All Payer Claims Data (MA APCD). Our proposed model allows the policymakers to estimate and include a penalty cost considering the economic and healthcare burden associated with prescription opioid diversion. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the ability of model and usefulness in determining optimal locations of opioid disposal kiosks and incentive disbursement plans for maximizing the disposal of unused opioids. The proposed optimization framework offers various trade-off strategies that can help government agencies design pragmatic policies for reducing the diversion of unused prescription opioids.",

Opioid use disorder is known to be under-coded as a diagnosis, yet problematic opioid use can be documented in clinical notes.   Objectives: Our goals were 1) to identify problematic opioid use from a full range of clinical notes; and 2) to compare the characteristics of patients identified as having problematic opioid use, exclusively documented in clinical notes, to those having documented ICD opioid use disorder diagnostic codes.   Materials and Methods: We developed and applied a natural language processing (NLP) tool to the clinical notes of a patient cohort (n=222,371) from two Veteran Affairs service regions to identify patients with problematic opioid use. We also used a set of ICD diagnostic codes to identify patients with opioid use disorder from the same cohort. We compared the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients identified only through NLP, to those of patients identified through ICD codes.   Results: NLP exclusively identified 57,331 patients; 6,997 patients had positive ICD code identifications. Patients exclusively identified through NLP were more likely to be women. Those identified through ICD codes were more likely to be male, younger, have concurrent benzodiazepine prescriptions, more comorbidities, more care encounters, and less likely to be married. Patients in the NLP and ICD groups had substantially elevated comorbidity levels compared to patients not documented as experiencing problematic opioid use.   Conclusions: NLP is a feasible approach for identifying problematic opioid use not otherwise recorded by ICD codes. Clinicians may be reluctant to code for opioid use disorder. It is therefore incumbent on the healthcare team to search for documentation of opioid concerns within clinical notes.",

    "snippet": "The opioid crisis remains one of the most daunting and complex public health problems in the United States. This study investigates the national epidemic by analyzing vulnerability profiles of three key factors: opioid-related mortality rates, opioid prescription dispensing rates, and disability rank ordered rates. This study utilizes county level data, spanning the years 2014 through 2020, on the rates of opioid-related mortality, opioid prescription dispensing, and disability. To successfully estimate and predict trends in these opioid-related factors, we augment the Kalman Filter with a novel spatial component. To define opioid vulnerability profiles, we create heat maps of our filter's predicted rates across the nation's counties and identify the hotspots. In this context, hotspots are defined on a year-by-year basis as counties with rates in the top 5 percent nationally. Our spatial Kalman filter demonstrates strong predictive performance. From 2014 to 2018, these predictions highlight consistent spatiotemporal patterns across all three factors, with Appalachia distinguished as the nation's most vulnerable region. Starting in 2019 however, the dispensing rate profiles undergo a dramatic and chaotic shift. The initial primary drivers of opioid abuse in the Appalachian region were likely prescription opioids; however, it now appears that abuse is sustained by illegal drugs. Additionally, we find that the disabled subpopulation may be more at risk of opioid-related mortality than the general population. Public health initiatives must extend beyond controlling prescription practices to address the transition to and impact of illicit drug use.",

    "snippet": "Opioid use disorder (OUD) continuously poses major public health challenges and social implications worldwide with dramatic rise of opioid dependence leading to potential abuse. Despite that a few pharmacological agents have been approved for OUD treatment, the efficacy of said agents for OUD requires further improvement in order to provide safer and more effective pharmacological and psychosocial treatments. Preferable therapeutic treatments of OUD rely on the advances in understanding the neurobiological mechanism of opioid dependence. Proteins including mu, delta, kappa, nociceptin, and zeta opioid receptors are the direct targets of opioids. Each receptor has a large protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, that behaves differently when subjected to various treatments, thus increasing the complexity in the drug development process for an effective opioid addiction treatment. The report below analyzes the work by presenting a PPI-network informed machine-learning study of OUD. We have examined more than 500 proteins in the five opioid receptor networks and subsequently collected 74 inhibitor datasets. Machine learning models were constructed by pairing gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) algorithm with two advanced natural language processing (NLP)-based molecular fingerprints. With these models, we systematically carried out evaluations of screening and repurposing potential of drug candidates for four opioid receptors. In addition, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) properties were also considered in the screening of potential drug candidates. Our study can be a valuable and promising tool of pharmacological development for OUD treatments.",

    "snippet": "COVID-19 has had a large scale negative impact on the health of opioid users exacerbating the health of an already vulnerable population. Critical information on the total impact of COVID-19 on opioid users is unknown due to a lack of comprehensive data on COVID-19 cases, inaccurate diagnostic coding, and lack of data coverage. To assess the impact of COVID-19 on small-area opioid mortality, we developed a Bayesian hierarchical excess opioid mortality modeling approach. We incorporate spatio-temporal autocorrelation structures to allow for sharing of information across small areas and time to reduce uncertainty in small area estimates. Excess mortality is defined as the difference between observed trends after a crisis and expected trends based on observed historical trends, which captures the total increase in observed mortality rates compared to what was expected prior to the crisis. We illustrate the application of our approach to assess excess opioid mortality risk estimates for 159 counties in GA. Using our proposed approach will help inform interventions in opioid-related public health responses, policies, and resource allocation. The application of this work also provides a general framework for improving the estimation and mapping of health indicators during crisis periods for the opioid user population.",

    "snippet": "The opioid crisis has been one of the most critical society concerns in the United States. Although the medication assisted treatment (MAT) is recognized as the most effective treatment for opioid misuse and addiction, the various side effects can trigger opioid relapse. In addition to MAT, the dietary nutrition intervention has been demonstrated its importance in opioid misuse prevention and recovery. However, research on the alarming connections between dietary patterns and opioid misuse remain under-explored. In response to this gap, in this paper, we first establish a large-scale multifaceted dietary benchmark dataset related to opioid users at the first attempt and then develop a novel framework - i.e., namely Opioid Misuse Detection with Interpretable Dietary Patterns (Diet-ODIN) - to bridge heterogeneous graph (HG) and large language model (LLM) for the identification of users with opioid misuse and the interpretation of their associated dietary patterns. Specifically, in Diet-ODIN, we first construct an HG to comprehensively incorporate both dietary and health-related information, and then we devise a holistic graph learning framework with noise reduction to fully capitalize both users' individual dietary habits and shared dietary patterns for the detection of users with opioid misuse. To further delve into the intricate correlations between dietary patterns and opioid misuse, we exploit an LLM by utilizing the knowledge obtained from the graph learning model for interpretation. The extensive experimental results based on our established benchmark with quantitative and qualitative measures demonstrate the outstanding performance of Diet-ODIN in exploring the complex interplay between opioid misuse and dietary patterns, by comparison with state-of-the-art baseline methods.",

Less is known about the unique risk conferred by each pain-management treatment, as treatments are typically implemented together, confounding their independent effects. We estimated the extent to which pain-management strategies were associated with risk of incident opioid use disorder (OUD) for those with chronic pain, controlling for baseline demographic and clinical confounding variables and holding other pain-management treatments at their observed levels.   Methods: We used data from two chronic pain subgroups within a cohort of non-pregnant Medicaid patients aged 35-64 years, 2016-2019, from 25 states: 1) those with a chronic pain condition co-morbid with physical disability (N=6,133) or 2) those with chronic pain without disability (N=67,438). We considered 9 pain-management treatments: prescription opioid i) dose and ii) duration; iii) number of opioid prescribers; opioid co-prescription with iv) benzodiazepines, v) muscle relaxants, and vi) gabapentinoids; vii) non-opioid pain prescription, viii) physical therapy, and ix) other pain treatment modality. Our outcome was incident OUD.   Results: Having an opioid and gabapentin co-prescription or an opioid and benzodiazepine co-prescription was statistically significantly associated with a 16-46% increased risk of OUD. Opioid dose and duration also were significantly associated with increased risk of OUD. Physical therapy was significantly associated with an 11% decreased risk of OUD in the subgroup with chronic pain but no disability.   Conclusions: Co-prescription of opioids with either gabapentin or benzodiazepines may substantially increase risk of OUD. More positively, physical therapy may be a relatively accessible and safe pain-management strategy.",

    "snippet": "Opioid addiction has become a global epidemic and a national health crisis in recent years, with the number of opioid overdose fatalities steadily increasing since the 1990s. In contrast to the dynamics of a typical illicit drug or disease epidemic, opioid addiction has its roots in legal, prescription medication - a fact which greatly increases the exposed population and provides additional drug accessibility for addicts. In this paper, we present a mathematical model for prescription drug addiction and treatment with parameters and validation based on data from the opioid epidemic. Key dynamics considered include addiction through prescription, addiction from illicit sources, and treatment. Through mathematical analysis, we show that no addiction-free equilibrium can exist without stringent control over how opioids are administered and prescribed, effectively transforming the dynamics of the opioid epidemic into those found in a purely illicit drug model. Numerical sensitivity analysis suggests that relatively low states of endemic addiction can be obtained by primarily focusing on medical prevention followed by aggressive treatment of remaining cases - even when the probability of relapse from treatment remains high. Further empirical study focused on understanding the rate of illicit drug dependence versus overdose risk, along with the current and changing rates of opioid prescription and treatment, would shed significant light on optimal control efforts and feasible outcomes for this epidemic and drug epidemics in general.",

While the scale of the problem is undeniable, estimates of the local prevalence of opioid misuse are lacking, despite their importance to policy-making and resource allocation. This is due, in part, to the challenge of directly measuring opioid misuse at a local level. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian hierarchical spatio-temporal abundance model that integrates indirect county-level data on opioid-related outcomes with state-level survey estimates on prevalence of opioid misuse to estimate the latent county-level prevalence and counts of people who misuse opioids. A simulation study shows that our integrated model accurately recovers the latent counts and prevalence. We apply our model to county-level surveillance data on opioid overdose deaths and treatment admissions from the state of Ohio. Our proposed framework can be applied to other applications of small area estimation for hard to reach populations, which is a common occurrence with many health conditions such as those related to illicit behaviors.",

    "snippet": "The opioid epidemic is a crisis that has plagued the United States (US) for decades. One central issue is inequitable access to treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), which puts certain populations at a higher risk of opioid overdose. We integrate a predictive dynamical model and a prescriptive optimization problem to compute high-quality opioid treatment facility and treatment budget allocations for each US state. Our predictive model is a differential equation-based epidemiological model that captures opioid epidemic dynamics. We use a process inspired by neural ODEs to fit this model to opioid epidemic data for each state and obtain estimates for unknown parameters in the model. We then incorporate this epidemiological model into a mixed-integer optimization problem (MIP) that aims to minimize opioid overdose deaths and the number of people with OUD. We develop strong relaxations based on McCormick envelopes to efficiently compute approximate solutions to our MIPs with a mean optimality gap of 3.99%. Our method provides socioeconomically equitable solutions, as it incentivizes investments in areas with higher social vulnerability (from the US Centers for Disease Control's Social Vulnerability Index) and opioid prescribing rates. On average, our approach decreases the number of people with OUD by 9.03 $\\pm$ 1.772%, increases the number of people in treatment by 88.75 $\\pm$ 26.223%, and decreases opioid-related deaths by 0.58 $\\pm$ 0.111% after 2 years compared to baseline epidemiological model predictions. Our solutions show that policy-makers should target adding treatment facilities to counties that have fewer facilities than their population share and are more socially vulnerable. We demonstrate that our optimization approach should help inform these decisions, as it yields population health benefits in comparison to benchmarks based solely on population and social vulnerability.",

To this end, we introduce a mathematical apparatus that minimizes the asymptotic exit-rate with which the solution for such stochastically perturbed prescription opioid epidemics exits from a given bounded open domain.

To improve the overdose surveillance and to identify the areas in need of prevention effort, in this work, we focus on forecasting opioid overdose using real-time crime dynamics. Previous work identified various types of links between opioid use and criminal activities, such as financial motives and common causes. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel spatio-temporal predictive model for opioid overdose forecasting by leveraging the spatio-temporal patterns of crime incidents. Our proposed model incorporates multi-head attentional networks to learn different representation subspaces of features. Such deep learning architecture, called \"community-attentive\" networks, allows the prediction of a given location to be optimized by a mixture of groups (i.e., communities) of regions. In addition, our proposed model allows for interpreting what features, from what communities, have more contributions to predicting local incidents as well as how these communities are captured through forecasting. Our results on two real-world overdose datasets indicate that our model achieves superior forecasting performance and provides meaningful interpretations in terms of spatio-temporal relationships between the dynamics of crime and that of opioid overdose.",

Research finds such overdose deaths are linked to neighborhood-level traits, thus providing opportunity to identify effective interventions. Typically, techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) or Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) are used to document neighborhood-level factors significant in explaining such adverse outcomes. These techniques are, however, less equipped to ascertain non-linear relationships between confounding factors. Hence, in this study we apply machine learning based techniques to identify opioid risks of neighborhoods in Delaware and explore the correlation of these factors using Shapley Additive explanations (SHAP). We discovered that the factors related to neighborhoods environment, followed by education and then crime, were highly correlated with higher opioid risk. We also explored the change in these correlations over the years to understand the changing dynamics of the epidemic. Furthermore, we discovered that, as the epidemic has shifted from legal (i.e., prescription opioids) to illegal (e.g.,heroin and fentanyl) drugs in recent years, the correlation of environment, crime and health related variables with the opioid risk has increased significantly while the correlation of economic and socio-demographic variables has decreased. The correlation of education related factors has been higher from the start and has increased slightly in recent years suggesting a need for increased awareness about the opioid epidemic.",

    "snippet": "The United States (US) opioid crisis contributed to 81,806 fatalities in 2022. It has strained hospitals, treatment facilities, and law enforcement agencies due to the enormous resources and procedures needed to respond to the crisis. As a result, many individuals who use opioids never receive or finish the treatment they need and instead have many interactions with hospitals or the criminal justice system. This paper introduces a discrete event simulation model that evaluates three opioid use disorder treatment policies: arrest diversion, re-entry case management, and overdose diversion. Publicly available data from 2011 to 2019 in Dane County, Wisconsin, was used to forecast opioid-related outcomes through 2032. Through analyzing a variety of policy-mix implementations, the study offers a versatile framework for evaluating policies at various implementation levels. The results demonstrate that treatment policies that create new pathways and programming by utilizing treatment services and successfully divert at least 20% of eligible individuals can lead to more opioid-resilient communities. The benefits increase when more policies are enacted and/or offered to more individuals, with the largest impact from overdose diversion, followed by re-entry case management, and the smallest impact from arrest diversion. The cumulative total reduction in societal costs from 2017 to 2032 ranges from \\$68 M (USD) to \\$1.06 B (USD), excluding implementation costs of policies. To reverse the opioid crisis within a community, treatment policies may need to be combined with other strategies, such as harm reduction, supply reduction, and use prevention.",

    "snippet": "Overdose related to prescription opioids have reached an epidemic level in the US, creating an unprecedented national crisis. This has been exacerbated partly due to the lack of tools for physicians to help predict the risk of whether a patient will develop opioid use disorder. Little is known about how machine learning can be applied to a big-data platform to ensure an informed, sustained and judicious prescribing of opioids, in particular for commercially insured population. This study explores Massachusetts All Payer Claims Data, a de-identified healthcare dataset, and proposes a machine learning framework to examine how na\\\"ive users develop opioid use disorder. We perform several feature selections techniques to identify influential demographic and clinical features associated with opioid use disorder from a class imbalanced analytic sample. We then compare the predictive power of four well-known machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting to predict the risk of opioid use disorder. The study results show that the Random Forest model outperforms the other three algorithms while determining the features, some of which are consistent with prior clinical findings. Moreover, alongside the higher predictive accuracy, the proposed framework is capable of extracting some risk factors that will add significant knowledge to what is already known in the extant literature. We anticipate that this study will help healthcare practitioners improve the current prescribing practice of opioids and contribute to curb the increasing rate of opioid addiction and overdose.",

    "snippet": "Opioid overdose has emerged as a full blown epidemic in the United States. In the last few years, there has been an alarming increase in Opioid related deaths, resulting in the loss of 63,600 lives in 2016 alone. The epidemic which is killing more than 100 people each day, was declared as a public health emergency by the US government, in October 2017. Although a few health related companies and commercial firms have examined this important issue from various available data sources, to the best of our knowledge, the academic community has not been engaged in research in this important topic. It can be safely noted that the study of the epidemic, from the data analytics perspective, is in its infancy. Given that a significant amount of Opioid related data is available in public domain, it provides the academic community an opportunity to analyze such data to provide recommendations to the public health authorities to mitigate the impact of the epidemic. In that vein, we collected some publicly available data to analyze the important contributing factors of the epidemic. In particular, we examine the role of the individuals prescribing Opioid drugs on the spread of the epidemic. In addition, we examine the impact of income level, age and educational level of various neighborhoods in a large US city, on Opioid related incidences, to find any correlation between them.",

In particular, we provide two-sided bounds on the solution of the transition density function for the Fokker-Planck equation that corresponds to the opioid epidemic dynamical model, when a random perturbation enters only through the dynamics of the susceptible group in the compartmental model. Here, the proof for such bounds basically relies on the interpretation of the solution for the transition density function as the value function of a certain optimal stochastic control problem. Finally, as a possible interesting development in this direction, we also provide an estimate for the attainable exit probability with which the solution for the randomly perturbed opioid epidemic dynamical model exits from a given bounded open domain during a certain time interval. Note that such qualitative information on the first exit-time as well as two-sided bounds on the transition density function are useful for developing effective and fact-informed intervention strategies that primarily aim at curbing opioid epidemics or assisting in interpreting outcome results from opioid-related policies.",

The development of medications with improved efficacy and safety profiles for OUD treatment is urgently needed. Drug repurposing is a promising option for drug discovery due to its reduced cost and expedited approval procedures. Computational approaches based on machine learning enable the rapid screening of DrugBank compounds, identifying those with the potential to be repurposed for OUD treatment. We collected inhibitor data for four major opioid receptors and used advanced machine learning predictors of binding affinity that fuse the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm with two natural language processing (NLP)-based molecular fingerprints and one traditional 2D fingerprint. Using these predictors, we systematically analyzed the binding affinities of DrugBank compounds on four opioid receptors. Based on our machine learning predictions, we were able to discriminate DrugBank compounds with various binding affinity thresholds and selectivities for different receptors. The prediction results were further analyzed for ADMET (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity), which provided guidance on repurposing DrugBank compounds for the inhibition of selected opioid receptors. The pharmacological effects of these compounds for OUD treatment need to be tested in further experimental studies and clinical trials. Our machine learning studies provide a valuable platform for drug discovery in the context of OUD treatment.",

While previous research has mostly focused on the \"number of mentions\" of scientific research on social media, the current study applies \"topic networks\" to measure public attention to scientific research on Twitter. Topic networks are the networks of co-occurring author keywords in scholarly publications and networks of co-occurring hashtags in the tweets mentioning those scholarly publications. This study investigates which topics in opioid scholarly publications have received public attention on Twitter. Additionally, it investigates whether the topic networks generated from the publications tweeted by all accounts (bot and non-bot accounts) differ from those generated by non-bot accounts. Our analysis is based on a set of opioid scholarly publications from 2011 to 2019 and the tweets associated with them. We use co-occurrence network analysis to generate topic networks. Results indicated that Twitter users have mostly used generic terms to discuss opioid publications, such as \"Opioid,\" \"Pain,\" \"Addiction,\" \"Treatment,\" \"Analgesics,\" \"Abuse,\" \"Overdose,\" and \"Disorders.\" Results confirm that topic networks provide a legitimate method to visualize public discussions of health-related scholarly publications and how Twitter users discuss health-related scientific research differently from the scientific community. There was a substantial overlap between the topic networks based on the tweets by all accounts and non-bot accounts. This result indicates that it might not be necessary to exclude bot accounts for generating topic networks as they have a negligible impact on the results.",

In order to better understand these interlocking crises, we use social media data to extract qualitative and quantitative insights on the experiences of opioid users during the Covid-19 pandemic. In particular, we use an unsupervised learning approach to create a rich geolocated data source for public health surveillance and analysis. To do this we first infer the location of 26,000 Reddit users that participate in opiate-related sub-communities (subreddits) by combining named entity recognition, geocoding, density-based clustering, and heuristic methods. Our strategy achieves 63 percent accuracy at state-level location inference on a manually-annotated reference dataset. We then leverage the geospatial nature of our user cohort to answer policy-relevant questions about the impact of varying state-level policy approaches that balance economic versus health concerns during Covid-19. We find that state government strategies that prioritized economic reopening over curtailing the spread of the virus created a markedly different environment and outcomes for opioid users.

Methods: We employ a classification system based on distance and disparity between dispensers, prescribers, and patients and conduct an ARIMA analysis on each class and without any class to examine the effect of the legislation on opioid prescriptions, considering secular trends and autocorrelation. The study also compares trends in benzodiazepine prescriptions as a control. Results: The proposed classification system clusters each transaction into 16 groups based on the location of the stakeholders. These categories were found to have different prescription volume levels, with the highest group averaging 96.50 in daily MME (95% CI [63.43, 99.57]) and the lowest 37.78 (95% CI [37.38,38.18]). The ARIMA models show a decrease in overall prescription volume from 53.68 (95% CI [53.33,54.02]) to 51.09 (95% CI [50.74,51.44]) and varying impact across the different classes. Conclusion: Policy was effective in reducing opioid prescription volume overall. However, the volume of prescriptions filled where the prescribing doctor is located more than 1000 miles away from the patient went up, hinting at the possibility of doctor shopping.",

Community-based social media platforms such as Reddit allow self-disclosure for users to discuss otherwise sensitive drug-related behaviors.

A common approach to obtain small area estimates of opioid mortality is to use a standard disease mapping approach in which population-at-risk estimates are treated as fixed and known. Assuming fixed populations ignores the uncertainty surrounding small area population estimates, which may bias risk estimates and under-estimate their associated uncertainties. We present a Bayesian Spatial Berkson Error (BSBE) model to incorporate population-at-risk uncertainty within a disease mapping model. We compare the BSBE approach to the naive (treating denominators as fixed) using simulation studies to illustrate potential bias resulting from this assumption. We show the application of the BSBE model to obtain 2020 opioid mortality risk estimates for 159 counties in GA accounting for population-at-risk uncertainty.

Specifically, we seek to estimate of the impact of key opioid-related policies by quantifying the effects of must access prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), naloxone access laws (NALs), and medical marijuana laws on opioid prescribing. Existing methods, such as differences-in-differences and synthetic controls, are challenging to apply in these types of dynamic policy landscapes where multiple policies are implemented over time and sample sizes are small. Autoregressive models are an alternative strategy that have been used to estimate policy effects in similar settings, but until this paper have lacked formal justification. We outline a set of assumptions that tie these models to causal effects, and we study biases of estimates based on this approach when key causal assumptions are violated. In a set of simulation studies that mirror the structure of our application, we also show that our proposed estimators frequently outperform existing estimators. In short, we justify the use of autoregressive models to provide robust evidence on the effectiveness of four state policies in combating the opioid crisis.",

    "snippet": "Machine learning algorithms can sometimes exacerbate health disparities based on ethnicity, gender, and other factors. There has been limited work at exploring potential biases within algorithms deployed on a small scale, and/or within minoritized communities. Understanding the nature of potential biases may improve the prediction of various health outcomes. As a case study, we used data from a sample of 539 young adults from minoritized communities who engaged in nonmedical use of prescription opioids and/or heroin. We addressed the indicated issues through the following contributions: 1) Using machine learning techniques, we predicted a range of opioid use outcomes for participants in our dataset; 2) We assessed if algorithms trained only on a majority sub-sample (e.g., Non-Hispanic/Latino, male), could accurately predict opioid use outcomes for a minoritized sub-sample (e.g., Latino, female). Results indicated that models trained on a random sample of our data could predict a range of opioid use outcomes with high precision. However, we noted a decrease in precision when we trained our models on data from a majority sub-sample, and tested these models on a minoritized sub-sample. We posit that a range of cultural factors and systemic forms of discrimination are not captured by data from majority sub-samples. Broadly, for predictions to be valid, models should be trained on data that includes adequate representation of the groups of people about whom predictions will be made. Stakeholders may utilize our findings to mitigate biases in models for predicting opioid use outcomes within minoritized communities.",

    "snippet": "Substance Use Disorders (SUDs) involve the misuse of any or several of a wide array of substances, such as alcohol, opioids, marijuana, and methamphetamine. SUDs are characterized by an inability to decrease use despite severe social, economic, and health-related consequences to the individual. A 2017 national survey identified that 1 in 12 US adults have or have had a substance use disorder. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that SUDs relating to alcohol, prescription opioids, and illicit drug use cost the United States over $520 billion annually due to crime, lost work productivity, and health care expenses. Most recently, the US Department of Health and Human Services has declared the national opioid crisis a public health emergency to address the growing number of opioid overdose deaths in the United States. In this interdisciplinary workshop, we explored how computational support - digital systems, algorithms, and sociotechnical approaches (which consider how technology and people interact as complex systems) - may enhance and enable innovative interventions for prevention, detection, treatment, and long-term recovery from SUDs.   The Computing Community Consortium (CCC) sponsored a two-day workshop titled \"Computational Support for Substance Use Disorder Prevention, Detection, Treatment, and Recovery\" on November 14-15, 2019 in Washington, DC. As outcomes from this visioning process, we identified three broad opportunity areas for computational support in the SUD context:   1. Detecting and mitigating risk of SUD relapse, 2. Establishing and empowering social support networks, and 3. Collecting and sharing data meaningfully across ecologies of formal and informal care.",

Besides the raw yearly deaths count that is worrisome per se, an alarming picture comes from the steep acceleration of such rate that increased by 21% from 2015 to 2016. While traditional public health surveillance suffers from its own biases and limitations, digital epidemiology offers a new lens to extract signals from Web and Social Media that might be complementary to official statistics. In this paper we present a computational approach to identify a digital cohort that might provide an updated and complementary view on the opioid crisis. We introduce an information retrieval algorithm suitable to identify relevant subspaces of discussion on social media, for mining data from users showing explicit interest in discussions about opioid consumption in Reddit. Moreover, despite the pseudonymous nature of the user base, almost 1.5 million users were geolocated at the US state level, resembling the census population distribution with a good agreement. A measure of prevalence of interest in opiate consumption has been estimated at the state level, producing a novel indicator with information that is not entirely encoded in the standard surveillance. Finally, we further provide a domain specific vocabulary containing informal lexicon and street nomenclature extracted by user-generated content that can be used by researchers and practitioners to implement novel digital public health surveillance methodologies for supporting policy makers in fighting the opioid epidemic.",

Specifically, using user posts, we trained 1) a binary classifier which predicts transitions from casual drug discussion forums to drug recovery forums and 2) a Cox regression model that outputs likelihoods of such transitions. In doing so, we found that utterances of select drugs and certain linguistic features contained in one's posts can help predict these transitions. Using unfiltered drug-related posts, our research delineates drugs that are associated with higher rates of transitions from recreational drug discussion to support/recovery discussion, offers insight into modern drug culture, and provides tools with potential applications in combating the opioid crisis.",

In addition, smart contracts are used to automate the machine learning process. This paper makes three contributions. First, it establishes a link between machine learning technology and blockchain technology. Previously, machine learning and blockchain have been considered two independent technologies without an obvious link. Second, it proposes a unified analytical framework for trustable machine learning by using blockchain technology. This unified framework solves both the trustability and automation issues in machine learning. Third, it enables a computer to translate core machine learning implementation from a single thread on a single machine to multiple threads on multiple machines running with blockchain by using a unified approach. The paper uses association rule mining as an example to demonstrate how trustable machine learning can be implemented with blockchain, and it shows how this approach can be used to analyze opioid prescriptions to help combat the opioid crisis.",

Predictions are that the number of drug addictions will continue to fluctuate with reduced amplitude and eventually stabilize. To seek the fountainhead of heroin, we identified the most likely origins of drugs in Philadelphia, PA, Cuyahoga and Hamilton, OH, Jefferson, KY, Kanawha, WV, and Bedford, VA. Based on the facts, advised concentration includes the spread of Oxycodone, Hydrocodone, Heroin, and Buprenorphine. In other words, drug transmission in the two states of Ohio and Pennsylvania require awareness. According to the propagation curve predicted by our model, the transfer of KY state is still in its early stage, while that of VA, WV is in the middle point, and OH, PA in its latter ones. As a result of this, the number of drug addictions in KY, OH, and VA is projected to increase in three years. For methodology, with the Principal component analysis technique, 22 variables in socio-economic data related to the continuous use of Opioid drugs was filtered, where the 'Relationship' Part deserves a highlight.   Based on them, by using the K-means algorithm, 464 counties were categorized into three baskets. To combat the opioid crisis, a specific action will discuss in the sensitivity analysis section. After modeling and analytics, innovation is required to control addicts and advocate anti-drug news campaigns. This part also verified the effectiveness of model when $d_1<0.2; r_1,r_2,r_3<0.3; 15<\\beta_1,\\beta_2,\\beta_3<25$.

    "snippet": "Drug overdose has become a public health crisis in the United States with devastating consequences. However, most of the drug overdose incidences are the consequence of recitative polysubstance usage over a defined period of time which can be happened by either the intentional usage of required drug with other drugs or by accident. Thus, predicting the effects of polysubstance usage is extremely important for clinicians to decide which combination of drugs should be prescribed. Recent advancement of structural causal models can provide ample insights of causal effects from observational data via identifiable causal directed graphs. In this paper, we propose a system to estimate heterogeneous concurrent drug usage effects on overdose estimation, that consists of efficient co-variate selection, sub-group selection and heterogeneous causal effect estimation. We apply our framework to answer a critical question, can concurrent usage of benzodiazepines and opioids have heterogeneous causal effects on the opioid overdose epidemic?

    "snippet": "Feature selection is an important but challenging task in causal inference for obtaining unbiased estimates of causal quantities. Properly selected features in causal inference not only significantly reduce the time required to implement a matching algorithm but, more importantly, can also reduce the bias and variance when estimating causal quantities. When feature selection techniques are applied in causal inference, the crucial criterion is to select variables that, when used for matching, can achieve an unbiased and robust estimation of causal quantities. Recent research suggests that balancing only on treatment-associated variables introduces bias while balancing on spurious variables increases variance. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced three-stage framework that shows a significant improvement in selecting the desired subset of variables compared to the existing state-of-the-art feature selection framework for causal inference, resulting in lower bias and variance in estimating the causal quantity. We evaluated our proposed framework using a state-of-the-art synthetic data across various settings and observed superior performance within a feasible computation time, ensuring scalability for large-scale datasets. Finally, to demonstrate the applicability of our proposed methodology using large-scale real-world data, we evaluated an important US healthcare policy related to the opioid epidemic crisis: whether opioid use disorder has a causal relationship with suicidal behavior.",

Modeling and prediction of drug and opioid hotspots, where a high percentage of events fall in a small percentage of space-time, could help better focus limited social and health services. In this work we present a spatial-temporal point process model for drug overdose clustering. The data input into the model comes from two heterogeneous sources: 1) high volume emergency medical calls for service (EMS) records containing location and time, but no information on the type of non-fatal overdose and 2) fatal overdose toxicology reports from the coroner containing location and high-dimensional information from the toxicology screen on the drugs present at the time of death. We first use non-negative matrix factorization to cluster toxicology reports into drug overdose categories and we then develop an EM algorithm for integrating the two heterogeneous data sets, where the mark corresponding to overdose category is inferred for the EMS data and the high volume EMS data is used to more accurately predict drug overdose death hotspots. We apply the algorithm to drug overdose data from Indianapolis, showing that the point process defined on the integrated data outperforms point processes that use only homogeneous EMS (AUC improvement .72 to .8) or coroner data (AUC improvement .81 to .85).We also investigate the extent to which overdoses are contagious, as a function of the type of overdose, while controlling for exogenous fluctuations in the background rate that might also contribute to clustering. We find that drug and opioid overdose deaths exhibit significant excitation, with branching ratio ranging from .72 to .98.",

    "snippet": "Public health organizations face the problem of dispensing treatments (i.e., vaccines, antibiotics, and others) to groups of affected populations through \"points-of-dispensing\" (PODs) during emergency situations, typically in the presence of complexities like demand stochasticity, heterogenous utilities (e.g., for vaccine distribution, certain segments of the population may need to be prioritized), and limited storage. We formulate a hierarchical Markov decision process (MDP) model with two levels of decisions (and decision-makers): the upper-level decisions come from an inventory planner that \"controls\" a lower-level dynamic problem, which optimizes dispensing decisions that take into consideration the heterogeneous utility functions of the random set of PODs. We then derive structural properties of the MDP model and propose an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm that leverages structure in both the policy and the value space (state-dependent basestocks and concavity, respectively). The algorithm can be considered an actor-critic method; to our knowledge, this paper is the first to jointly exploit policy and value structure within an actor-critic framework. We prove that the policy and value function approximations each converge to their optimal counterparts with probability one and provide a comprehensive numerical analysis showing improved empirical convergence rates when compared to other ADP techniques. Finally, we show how an aggregation-based version of our algorithm can be applied in a realistic case study for the problem of dispensing naloxone (an overdose reversal drug) via first responders amidst the ongoing opioid crisis.",

    "snippet": "Physiological responses to pain have received increasing attention among researchers for developing an automated pain recognition sensing system. Though less explored, Blood Volume Pulse (BVP) is one of the candidate physiological measures that could help objective pain assessment. In this study, we applied machine learning techniques on BVP signals to device a non-invasive modality for pain sensing. Thirty-two healthy subjects participated in this study. First, we investigated a novel set of time-domain, frequency-domain and nonlinear dynamics features that could potentially be sensitive to pain. These include 24 features from BVP signals and 20 additional features from Inter-beat Intervals (IBIs) derived from the same BVP signals. Utilizing these features, we built machine learning models for detecting the presence of pain and its intensity. We explored different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Among them, we found that the XGBoost offered the best model performance for both pain classification and pain intensity estimation tasks. The ROC-AUC of the XGBoost model to detect low pain, medium pain and high pain with no pain as the baseline were 80.06 %, 85.81 %, and 90.05 % respectively. Moreover, the XGboost classifier distinguished medium pain from high pain with ROC-AUC of 91%. For the multi-class classification among three pain levels, the XGBoost offered the best performance with an average F1-score of 80.03%. Our results suggest that BVP signal together with machine learning algorithms is a promising physiological measurement for automated pain assessment. This work will have a national impact on accurate pain assessment, effective pain management, reducing drug-seeking behavior among patients, and addressing national opioid crisis.",

In this work, we explore the utility of a voice interface to support MBSR home practice.   Methods: We interviewed ten mindfulness program facilitators to understand how such a technology might fit in the context of the MBSR class and identify potential usability issues with our prototype. We then used directed content analysis to identify key themes and sub-themes within the interview data.   Results: Our findings show that facilitators supported the use of the voice interface for MBSR, particularly for individuals with limited motor function. Facilitators also highlighted unique affordances of voice interfaces, including perceived social presence, to support sustained engagement.   Conclusion: We demonstrate the acceptability of a voice interface to support home practice for MBSR participants among trained mindfulness facilitators. Based on our findings, we outline design recommendations for technologies aiming to provide longitudinal support for mindfulness-based interventions. Future work should further these efforts towards making non-addictive pain management interventions accessible and efficacious for a wide audience of users.",

    "snippet": "The escalating drug addiction crisis in the United States underscores the urgent need for innovative therapeutic strategies. This study embarked on an innovative and rigorous strategy to unearth potential drug repurposing candidates for opioid and cocaine addiction treatment, bridging the gap between transcriptomic data analysis and drug discovery. We initiated our approach by conducting differential gene expression analysis on addiction-related transcriptomic data to identify key genes. We propose a novel topological differentiation to identify key genes from a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network derived from DEGs. This method utilizes persistent Laplacians to accurately single out pivotal nodes within the network, conducting this analysis in a multiscale manner to ensure high reliability. Through rigorous literature validation, pathway analysis, and data-availability scrutiny, we identified three pivotal molecular targets, mTOR, mGluR5, and NMDAR, for drug repurposing from DrugBank. We crafted machine learning models employing two natural language processing (NLP)-based embeddings and a traditional 2D fingerprint, which demonstrated robust predictive ability in gauging binding affinities of DrugBank compounds to selected targets. Furthermore, we elucidated the interactions of promising drugs with the targets and evaluated their drug-likeness. This study delineates a multi-faceted and comprehensive analytical framework, amalgamating bioinformatics, topological data analysis and machine learning, for drug repurposing in addiction treatment, setting the stage for subsequent experimental validation. The versatility of the methods we developed allows for applications across a range of diseases and transcriptomic datasets.",
